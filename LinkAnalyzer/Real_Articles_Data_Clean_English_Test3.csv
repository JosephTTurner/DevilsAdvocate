Qualcomm s licensing scheme years  If Apple refused pay royalty  Qualcomm could cut modem supply  forcing Apple rely inferior chips  That calculation changed 2015  Apple began working Intel Corp

In August 2016  KFTC interviewed Apple  Qualcomm says Apple s statement regulators contained lies  why  next month  Qualcomm stopped paying usual rebates Apple  effectively raising company s per phone royalty rate  In retaliation  January year  Apple sued  accusing Qualcomm operating  extortion scheme  Around time  Apple informed five contract manufacturers assemble iPhones China would longer reimburse Qualcomm s royalties  The manufacturers promptly stopped making payments  Qualcomm executives see victims powerful company that s attempting wring little profit margin maturing product line  In July  Qualcomm sued Apple  claiming infringed six new Qualcomm patents related battery life graphics processing  It also asked U S  International Trade Commission the government agency charged

Qualcomm adapted industry  Sewell says  That would damage Qualcomm s market value stature  something wouldn t unprecedented  Earlier year  longtime Apple supplier graphics chips  Imagination

lovers ones offering Swift way out  At several points album  focusses burgeoning romance that s enabled tune scornful noise past two years  The rest world falls away new man  doesn t bother reading tabloids see people saying her   My reputation s never worse  must like me  whispers   Delicate  She found relief unexpected place  But anxiety lurks beneath escape  get sense she s looking shoulder every moment  These days  find Swift  baby hedonist  meeting men dark bars  buying dress lover  take off  dropping curse word the first career stronger  damn   hell and channelling  Criminal era Fiona Apple   They say I something bad  why s feel good  sings breathily  bleating electronic beat   I Did Something Bad  Her gaze  trained failures betrayals personal orbit  turned inward  revels state sin sometimes clumsily  sometimes deftly   Thankfully  album doesn t contain much cartoonish revenge drama lead single   Look What You Made Me Do  says  old Taylor can t come phone right now  Why  Oh   cause she s dead   It s surprise I turned    Cause us traitors never win  sings  eager implicate herself   Getaway Car  song leaving one man another  Of course  doesn t surrender fully disgraced status  can t help let self pity seep in   They re burning witches  even aren t one  sings   I Did Something Bad  making thinly veiled reference political melodrama  This air newfound jadedness one many ways Swift broadcasts long overdue loss innocence  Reputation  album captures singer turbulent commercially successful period career  Swift went hibernation last year  budding country star become international pop icon suddenly finding wrong end long running public feud Kanye West  Now emerges victim turned antihero  On  Reputation  embittered vindictive toward public feels abandoned her  she

Reputation  none jarring admission made  So It Goes  In first flush romance  she s making confession love interest   I m chill  sings   But make jealous  This Swift the unyielding perfectionist  professionally heartbroken woman built career enacting lyrical revenge lovers characterizing  chill  She grown fond word  also appears  Delicate  She asks suitor   Is chill you re head  If wink either lines  it s imperceptible  The current landscape pop dominated complicated moody young women Halsey  Lorde  Lana Del Rey  wear imperfections proudly allow darkness surface music  Wholesomeness gone fashion  Swift s abrupt moment maturation finds playing catch up  In bid self defamation  confessing flawed  like everyone else  simply trying fit in  Is reclaiming narrative  acceding it   Reputation  raises questions  doesn t bother answering them  Swift always lauded emotional precision words nuance melodies  Even sentiment tone precious wounded  still room appreciate craft lines   Loving like driving new Maserati dead end street  sang title track  Red  2012  album boldly straddled pop country divide  Part singer  part diarist  Swift switch effortlessly swelling pop choruses intricate  conversational verses filled wry revealing asides point shrewd tactician beneath veil wholesome country starlet  But  Swift grown pop stardom  abandoned much sharpness specificity expression  On previous album   1989  2014   Reputation  moves away internal monologue  grappling instead desires anxieties imagined audience  This tendency produced flashes cynicism condescension toward listeners formerly never present Swift s world   Don t Blame Me  feels like focus grouped scrapbook haphazard images concerning betrayal lust   I m insane I m baby   Echoes name inside mind   Halo  hiding obsession   I poison ivy  I m daisy  sings  It one emotionally incoherent songs career  If wants escape image imposed public  camouflaging muddled pop clich certainly one strategy  This kind thing would make  Reputation  feel generic disembodied sound skillfully executed  Swift abandoned ambition  perfectionism  In era streaming singles  rare young star still worships altar album  old fashioned instinct serves surprisingly well  She consistent singer songwriter generation   Reputation  impressively short filler  Every chorus huge memorable  pulls bracing tone shifts within single song  On opener   Ready It  moves elegantly menacing exuberant back again  flaunting old songwriting chops  Even  End Game  collaboration Future Ed Sheeran on paper  nightmarish mismatch styles is embarrassing unexpectedly thrilling  On  Reputation  Swift teamed producers Max Martin Jack Antonoff  helped imbue  1989  modern deferential take eighties synth pop  This time  Antonoff higher billing Martin  It s leap newly minted back of the house superstar  helped revitalize sometimes directionless world contemporary pop made white women  refashioning refining eighties Lorde  St  Vincent  Pink  Swift  But Swift moves eighties present day  incorporating big room electronic flourishes stuttering hiccups standard contemporary hip hop  On  Delicate  even flirts version light Caribbean sound infiltrated pop radio recent years  And stays within narrower range vocal melodies  sticking chant like choruses sometimes obscuring voice vocoder burying deep mix another way  Reputation  ceded Swift s ownership sound force bigger her  thing  Maybe sounds like grand reckoning with public image  getting older  increasingly fractured sound pop today  And yet still something  Reputation  feels sealed rest world  Swift nods forces hip hop  R    B  electronic dance music  never fully invites space  remains aseptic  For Swift  Antonoff Martin  may last moment avoid confronting streaming enabled  rapidly growing margins   Reputation  subtly bends cautious Swift whims mainstream  still argues favor pop music culturally neutral force  The album tries nail center pop time thing hardly exists  In future  people

But Boies feel need respond considered  fair important  questions hiring investigators  He said consider contractual provisions directing Black Cube stop publication Times story conflict interest  firm also representing newspaper libel suit  From beginning  said  advised Weinstein  that story could stopped threats influence way story could stopped convincing Times rape  Boies told never pressured news outlet   If evidence could uncovered convince Times charges published  I believe  believe  would averse Times  interest  He conceded  however  efforts profile undermine reporters  Times

said aware work related McGowan  whose allegations Weinstein denied   Given known time  I thought entirely appropriate investigate precisely accused doing  investigate whether facts would rebut accusations  said  Of representation Weinstein general  said   I don t believe former lawyers criticize former clients  But expressed regrets   Although vigorously denies using physical force  Mr

Senate Can Fix It,The White House wants get tax bill passed  Thursday just hours Senate Republicans unveiled outline tax proposal  Gary Cohn  Donald Trump s top economic adviser  told CNBC s John Harwood President laid  two really important principles  guide lawmakers officials putting legislation together   Number one deliver middle class tax cuts hardworking families country  Cohn said   Number two  corporate tax system competitive rest world  We create corporate tax rate  along pass through tax rate  makes us competitive rest world attract businesses back United States  Yet since last week  Paul Ryan House Republicans released tax plan  it s clear Trump s two principles run conflict other  Or  rather  principles run laws arithmetic  fact isn t enough money Republicans  budget  even using fuzzy fiscal math Party favors  provide big giveaways businesses households  Something give  businesses households  House Republicans went businesses  From we ve seen Senate bill  far  same  The proposal follows basic framework Ryan plan  slashing corporate tax rate thirty five per cent twenty per cent giving big tax cut Donald Trump owners unincorporated businesses  One concessions Republican senators making concerns Democrats deficit hawks raised one year delay implementing corporate tax cut  Given big cut is  corporations willing wait  We don t yet independent analyses Senate proposal would affect different income groups  aspect  too  likely track Ryan bill  According new analysis nonpartisan Tax Policy Center  Ryan bill would give taxpayers middle twenty per cent income distribution 2018 tax cut eight hundred forty dollars   16 15 week  average  Compared  37 440 break taxpayers top one per cent would receive  that s much  But least it s something  This snapshot bill s effect  hardworking families  Cohn referred CNBC interview  however  misleading  Over time  modest tax breaks people would initially receive would erode and ten years many would paying money  less  federal government  By 2027  according figures contained Tax Policy Center s study   families children earn fifty seventy five thousand dollars annually would subjected tax increase two hundred thirty dollars year   4 42 week  average  Families children earn forty fifty thousand dollars would face slightly larger tax increase  two hundred forty dollars   4 62 week  The Times s David Leonhardt  also written figures  suggested new name G O P  bill   Paul Ryan s 2017 Tax Increase Middle Class Families  Clearly  Ryan Trump wouldn t embrace moniker  But end proposal  given principles claim started with  In answering question  necessary take account arithmetic  Senate s procedural rules  G O P s desire pay back wealthy corporate individual donors  To pass tax bill fifty one votes Senate rather sixty the Republicans must keep over all cost proposal  1 5 trillion ten years  Even allowing one year delay implementing corporate tax cut  business provisions G O P s plans swallow lion s share sum  According analysis Senate Republicans  plan Joint Committee Taxation released Thursday  cutting corporate tax rate twenty per cent starting 2019 would cost  1 33 trillion 2027  The Senate s version tax cut unincorporated businesses  somewhat different one House plan  would cost  285 billion  If combine two items alone  get  1 62 trillion which already  1 5 trillion limit  To sure  House Senate bills include offsetting revenue raisers corporate side  mostly limiting various types deductions  But even accounting offsets  cost business tax cuts comes trillion dollars  That greatly limits scope universal tax cuts personal side  G O P s determination abolish Alternative Minimum Tax  designed insure wealthy people clever accountants  Trump  pay least federal taxes  Over ten years  getting rid A M T  adds another seven hundred billion dollars tab  The business tax cuts A M T  abolition don t leave room ordinary American households receive substantial tax cuts  Both Republican bills expand family tax credits reduce marginal tax rates households would face  also claw back lot revenue ways  targeted families  For example  two bills would replace individual tax exemptions standard household exemption twenty four thousand dollars year  For small families  change could advantageous  would hurt families lot children  and lot exemptions  And expanded tax credits expire 2022  makes far less valuable  Meanwhile  new way calculating inflation would gradually push taxpayers kinds higher tax brackets  The upshot Republican tax proposals  Trump promoted promising biggest tax cuts history  isn t much tax cut sense Americans understand term  It s really designed reduce tax burden businesses wealthy individuals  could justified if  defying history  delivered economy wide upsurge G D P  growth  capital investment  wages White House promised  Cohn talked interview  The supposed middle class tax cuts fig leaf  And lift leaf  truly regressive deceitful nature bill revealed

April  concentration carbon dioxide atmosphere reached record four hundred ten parts per million  The amount CO 2 air probably greater it s time since mid Pliocene  three half million years ago  lot less ice poles sea levels sixty feet higher  This year s record surpassed next year  next year s year that  Even every country fulfills pledges made Paris climate accord and United States said doesn t

way slow rise CO 2 reverse it  The process sometimes referred  negative emissions  instead adding carbon air  subtracts it  Carbon removal plants could built anywhere  everywhere  Construct enough and  theory least  CO 2 emissions could continue unabated still could avert calamity  Depending look things  technology represents either ultimate insurance policy ultimate moral hazard  Carbon Engineering one half dozen companies vying prove carbon removal feasible  Others include Global Thermostat  based New York  Climeworks  based near Zurich  Most owe origins ideas physicist named Klaus Lackner  works Arizona State University  Tempe  way home British Columbia I took detour visit him  It July  day I arrived temperature city reached hundred twelve degrees  When I got hotel  one first things I noticed dead starling lying  feet up  parking lot  I wondered died heat exhaustion  Lackner  sixty five  grew Germany  He tall lanky  fringe gray hair prominent forehead  I met office institute runs  Center Negative Carbon Emissions  The office bare  except New Yorker cartoons theme nerd dom  which  Lackner told me  wife cut him  In one  couple scientists stand front enormous whiteboard covered equations   The math right  one says   It s poor taste  In late nineteen seventies  Lackner moved Germany California study George Zweig  one discoverers quarks  A years later  got job Los Alamos National Laboratory  There  worked fusion   Some work classified  said   some not  Fusion process powers stars and  closer home  thermonuclear bombs  When Lackner Los Alamos  touted solution world s energy problem  fusion could harnessed  could generate vast amounts carbon free power using isotopes hydrogen  Lackner became convinced fusion reactor was  minimum  decades away   Decades later  it s generally agreed workable reactor still decades away  Meanwhile  globe s growing population would demand energy  demand would met  part  fossil fuels   I realized  probably earlier most  claims demise fossil fuels greatly exaggerated  Lackner told me   In fact  fossil fuels currently provide eighty per cent world s energy  Proportionally  figure hasn t changed much since mid eighties  but  global energy use nearly doubled  amount coal  oil  natural gas burned today almost two times greater  One evening early nineties  Lackner beer friend  Christopher Wendt  also physicist  The two got wondering why  Lackner put me   nobody s really crazy  big things anymore  This led questions conversations  and possibly beers  Eventually  two produced equation dense paper argued self replicating machines could solve world s energy problem and  less time  clean mess humans made burning fossil fuels  The machines would powered solar panels  multiplied they d produce solar panels  they d assemble using elements  like silicon aluminum  extracted ordinary dirt  The expanding collection panels would produce ever power  rate would increase exponentially  An array covering three hundred eighty six thousand square miles an area larger Nigeria but  Lackner Wendt noted   smaller many deserts could supply world s electricity many times over  This array could put use scrubbing

carbon dioxide removal  particularly what s become known  direct air capture   Sometimes thinking extreme end point learn lot  said  He began giving talks writing papers subject  Some scientists decided nuts  others visionary   Klaus is  fact  genius  Julio Friedmann  former Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Energy expert carbon management  told me  In 2000  Lackner received job offer Columbia University  Once New York  pitched plan developing carbon sucking technology Gary Comer  founder Lands  End  Comer brought meeting investment adviser  quipped Lackner wasn t looking venture capital much  adventure capital  Nevertheless  Comer offered put five million dollars  The new company called Global Research Technologies  G R T  It got far building small prototype  looking new investors financial crisis hit   Our timing exquisite  Lackner told me  Unable raise funds  company ceased operations  As planet continued warm  carbon dioxide levels continued climb  Lackner came believe that  unwittingly  humanity already committed negative emissions   I think we re uncomfortable situation  said   I would argue technologies pull CO 2 environment fail we re deep trouble  Lackner founded Center Negative Carbon Emissions A S U  2014  Most equipment dreams put together workshop blocks office  The day I there  hot outside even five minute walk workshop required staging  Lackner delivered short lecture dangers dehydration handed bottle water  In workshop  engineer tinkering looked like guts foldout couch  Where  living room version  would mattress  one elaborate array plastic ribbons  Embedded ribbon powder made thousands upon thousands tiny amber colored beads  The beads  Lackner explained  could purchased truckload  composed resin normally used water treatment

fold device sealed container filled water  The CO 2 captured powder dry phase would released wet phase  could piped container  whole process re started  couch folding unfolding again  Lackner calculated apparatus size semi trailer could remove ton carbon dioxide per day  three hundred sixty five tons year  The world s cars  planes  refineries  power plants produce thirty six billion tons CO 2 annually  so  told me   if built hundred million trailer size units could actually keep current emissions  He acknowledged figure sounded daunting  But  noted  iPhone around decade so  seven hundred million use   We still early game  said  The way Lackner sees things  key avoiding  deep trouble  thinking differently   We need change paradigm  told me  Carbon dioxide regarded way view waste products  like sewage garbage  We don t expect people stop producing waste   Rewarding people going bathroom less would nonsensical  Lackner observed  At time  don t let shit sidewalk toss empty yogurt containers street   If I tell garbage I m dumping front house twenty per cent less year last year  would still think I m something intolerable  Lackner said  One reasons we ve made little progress climate change  contends  issue acquired ethical charge  polarized people  To extent emissions seen bad  emitters become guilty   Such moral stance makes virtually everyone sinner  makes hypocrites many concerned climate change still partake benefits modernity  written  Changing paradigm  Lackner believes  change conversation  If CO 2 treated another form waste  disposed of  people stop arguing whether it s problem finally start something  Carbon dioxide  discovered  Scottish physician named Joseph Black  1754  A decade later  another Scotsman  James Watt  invented efficient

Holthaus  meteorologist turned columnist  recently wrote  Meanwhile  still warming locked in  There s much inertia climate system  vast earth itself  globe yet fully adjust hundreds billions tons carbon dioxide added atmosphere past decades  It s calculated equilibrate current CO 2 levels planet still needs warm half degree  And every ten days another billion tons carbon dioxide released  Last

climate negotiations held Cancn 2010  Meeting Paris 2015  world leaders decided two degree threshold high  stated aim climate accord hold  the increase global average temperature well 2 C  try limit 1 5 C  Since planet already warmed one degree and  practical purposes  committed another half degree  would seem impossible meet latter goal nearly impossible meet former  And nearly impossible  unless world switches course instead adding CO 2 atmosphere also starts remove it  The extent world counting negative emissions documented latest report Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change  published year Paris  To peer future  I P C C  relies computer models represent world s energy climate systems tangle equations  programmed play different  scenarios  Most scenarios involve temperature increases two

found math punishing  Global emissions would fall rapidly dramatically pretty much zero middle century   This would entail  among things  replacing world s power plants  revamping agricultural systems  eliminating gasoline powered vehicles  within next decades  Alternatively  humanity could  effect  go hock  It could allow CO 2 levels temporarily exceed two degree threshold a situation that s become known  overshoot and then  via negative emissions  pull excess CO 2 air  The I P C C  considered thousand possible scenarios  Of these  hundred sixteen limit warming two degrees  hundred eight

Geden  head E U  research division German Institute International Security Affairs  told me  Lackner said   I think I P C C  really saying  We tried lots lots scenarios  and  scenarios stayed safe  virtually every one needed magic touch negative emissions  If didn t that  ran brick wall    Pursued scale envisioned I P C C  carbon dioxide removal would yield first tens billions soon hundreds

Serhiy Gorbatyuk  head special investigations unit Ukrainian general prosecutor s office  told POLITICO  Gorbatyuk team tasked digging alleged illegal  under the table payments Ukraine s pro Russian former president  Viktor Yanukovych  deposed pro Western revolution three years ago  Manafort  whose work political advisor Yanukovych nearly decade provided bulk material U S  indictment  figures two Ukrainian investigations  The first  referred locally  black ledgers  case  concerns  2 billion allegedly off the books disbursements Yanukovych s Party Regions  Last year New York Times revealed Manafort s name appeared 22 times among hundreds pages handwritten entries  alleged payments totaling  12 7 million   Though Manafort denied receiving money  revelations contributed resignation Trump s campaign manager August 2016  The second investigation looking 2012 report prepared Ukrainian government New York City law firm Skadden  Arps  Meagher   Flom  Manafort helped arrange report  seen exonerate Yanukovych jailing main political opponent  former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko  The report  Ukraine s justice ministry claimed time  independent  looked allegations Tymoshenko s trial conviction 2011 full legal violations politically motivated  Skadden found though discrepancies prosecution  verdict Tymoshenko fair  Officially  Skadden Arps paid less  12 000 work   suspiciously low figure  investigators say  since allowed government award law firm contract without open tender  Gorbatyuk group suspected real figure much higher  Ukrainian government funds used illegally  Last Monday received first outside confirmation  courtesy Robert Mueller   MANAFORT GATES also lobbied connection roll report concerning Tymoshenko trial commissioned Government Ukraine  MANAFORT GATES used one offshore accounts funnel  4 million pay secretly report  paragraph 22 special counsel s indictment read  referring Manafort s associate  Rick Gates  also indicted   Our assumptions correct  Gorbatyuk said  Manafort  Gates Skadden representatives denied wrongdoing  And Kiev prosecutors charged crimes  Still  Gorbatyuk wants question ongoing cases Ukrainian officials  And investigators turn evidence Americans involved illegally transferring receiving money Ukraine  could indicted co conspirators  But possibility  road  officials say   It position talk someone haven t charged  Gorbatyuk told me   Right now  want speak Manafort  people from  Skadden witnesses  However  even getting point could question Manafort proven difficult  Under mutual legal agreement United States  Ukrainians contacted American counterparts December 2014 request help organize interview Skadden s lead lawyer report  former White House counsel Gregory Craig  followed another early 2015 asking talk Manafort  The requests went unanswered  however  prompting Ukrainians send number follow up letters  The U S  indictment provided window opportunity  After James Comey  FBI head time  questioned bureau s silence issue congressional hearing  Ukrainians finally received answer sorts  They could interview Manafort Craig  decide whether speak two men person  let FBI them  But catch  If wanted travel U S  themselves  process could take year half  If not  FBI could finish process within three months   Because we d already waiting two years  chose second option   sent extra six pages questions  said Andriy Radionov  prosecutor Gorbatyuk s unit  That June   Since then  haven t heard hide hair  about answers questions  said Gorbatyuk  Still  U S  indictment provided window opportunity  Gorbatyuk said unit would make another request interview Manafort upcoming days   We hope remarks ultimately benefit investigations former government figures  Gorbatyuk said  Ukrainian officials say Mueller s team investigators contacted requests assistance  If do  Kiev says it s prepared lend hand  And Ukrainians presumably would lot share that s potential interest  According indictment  around  75 million passed Manafort Gates  offshore accounts various tax havens  work 2006 2015 Yanukovych government Ukrainian political parties  Of this  Manafort laundered around  18

committed previous administration   My government term office absolutely relations scandal  Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman told Canadian Broadcasting Corporation  But might President Donald Trump sees it  Trump already accused Kiev attempted  sabotage  presidential campaign   perception based part Ukrainian officials  disclosures Manfort s alleged link black ledgers  Ukraine s President Petro Poroshenko appears surmounted distrust  The two leaders met  Trump voiced support Ukraine continuing undeclared war neighboring Russia  But Trump could interpret revelations Manafort attack presidency   It seems Poroshenko would happy forget name  Manafort  said Serhiy Leshchenko  Ukrainian MP exposed possible scheme former Trump campaign chairman received illegal payments   Now wants create good relationship Trump neutralize investigations  The investigations also facing resistance entrenched interests within Ukraine  Post revolution  anti corruption cases whole ground standstill  To date  one high level official Yanukovych regime convicted  Manafort s name one black ledgers  list people would like see case disappear long  Gorbatyuk team say feeling pressure abandon efforts  They assert due recent change criminal procedure code  November 20 1 000 cases   including Skadden Arps black ledgers   transferred prosecutor s office newly created National Anti Corruption Bureau  lacks resources investigate number cases  Gorbatyuk believes attempt government  bury  anti corruption investigations previous government   Even justice system doesn t work Ukraine  United States least does    Sevgil Musaieva Borovyk  chief editor Ukrainska Pravda  Taking everything consideration  seems agreement previous present governments  said investigator Radionov  Government officials deny trying deep six criminal proceedings  In statement  press office general prosecutor Yury Lutsenko  close ally President Poroshenko  said   The General Prosecutor s Office Ukraine guided exclusively legal norms activities  Therefore  absolutely incorrect raise question transfer criminal proceedings   made political basis  The days may numbered Skadden black ledger cases  But shelved  would nearly impossible say ultimately main cause  Both fear damaging relations Trump administration domestic pressures seem equally strong factors within Ukraine  At time  Mueller investigation could instead give new impetus investigations  Most Ukrainian news outlets devoted substantial airtime column inches announcement Manafort s indictment  public interest seems high see coming weeks bring American spin doctor  many hold responsible bringing kleptocratic Yanukovych power  In quarters political elite  reaction jubilant   Even justice system doesn t work Ukraine  United States least does

Sunday  First  Buffalo s spirit shattered 298 Saints rushing yards one greatest platonic ideals power football recorded century  Then  Bills  logic split open Wednesday coach Sean McDermott announced quarterback Tyrod Taylor would benched rookie fifth round pick Nathan Peterman  A team built around defense turnover margin gave 81 points two embarrassing weeks  switched overachieving veteran quarterback giving one game new No  1 receiver  Got it  This move expected August  Taylor remnant old Bills regime  Peterman s hand picked prospect new guard  But Taylor s difficult preseason  encouraging nine game stretch became one reasons Bills position make first playoff appearance 18 years  Taylor coming worst game season  taken many checkdowns long yardage situations New Orleans  But full scale meltdown entire Bills team  especially coaching staff defense  For season  Taylor consistently executed game plan little margin error  making multiple big plays per week team doesn t throw ball often many receiving weapons  After injuries Charles Clay Jordan Matthews early season  Taylor kept Buffalo s offense efficient despite players like Nick O Leary Deonte Thompson top targets wins  I grade snap taken season Taylor ranked 15th among starting quarterbacks far year  He finished last two seasons lower No  18 QB Index  Pro Football Focus ranked ninth season  he s currently 16th passer rating 10 touchdowns three interceptions  Not mention  Taylor boasts one best skill sets runner football  He s capable starter league short them  Bills clearly don t want him  This type move teams don t look back from   The closest analogy I come with  it s close  Giants benched Kurt Warner 5 4 No  1 overall pick Eli Manning  New York finished season 6 10  Taylor  meanwhile  look forward new team 2018  He  6 million bonus due March surely released Bills can t find trading partner him  So could end up  Cleveland Browns  Reports last March suggested Browns significant interest Taylor restructured contract stay Buffalo  Jacksonville Jaguars  While Taylor Jaguars offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett didn t cross paths Buffalo  Tyrod s mobility could make nice fit Jaguars offense still needs quarterback upgrade  New York Jets  No team starting scratch quarterback Jets  list like this  Arizona Cardinals  It s difficult guess entire organization look next season  won t surprise Cards looking new starter  Baltimore Ravens  Taylor experienced greatest success Greg Roman  assistant Baltimore  It s hard imagine Ravens moving Joe Flacco  32 year old ranked dead last yards per attempt  Taylor handled latest setback equanimity  much like year ago benched EJ Manuel   I don t look life fair unfair  Taylor said Wednesday Bills podium perhaps last time  It s healthiest way approach life NFL  especially quarterback Buffalo  This Quarterback Index  The QBs ranked based 2017 play only  The next ranking 32 starters comes Week 12  TOP SHELF 1 Tom Brady QB Patriots 2017 stats

essentially gave running ball last Thursday  going empty backfields downs throughout second half leading Arizona  That s sign broken offense hoping playmaker QB save it  Brees got front row seat Buffalo watch New Orleans  offensive line maul Bills  It s almost like Saints quit season  can t get better performance  Having O line healthy intact also reap dividends aerial attack  Brees getting plenty time throw  passing predictable running downs  Defenses naturally begin live one on one matchups outside effort slow Saints  fierce running game  Brees capable taking advantage  KNOCKING ON THE

Springs  Texas  wife s family worshipped  He fired assault style rifle congregation full children grandparents  killing 26 people injuring 20 more  Survivors said prowled aisle looking shoot crying babies mothers huddled pews  Among dead  toddler  pastor s daughter  two first time attendees unborn child  It massacre could never predicted  But perhaps could prevented  Like convicted domestic abusers  Kelley supposed access firearms  But Air Force acknowledged wake shooting appeared Kelley s domestic violence conviction wasn t entered National Crime Information Center  NCIC  database  likely able pass background check  This hardly isolated error  According Florida International University report obtained TIME  military mishandled roughly 1 300 domestic violence cases 2004 2012  including misclassifications allowed abusers go unreported NCIC   There thousands cases misclassified  says Eric Carpenter  associate professor FIU former Army lawyer spent years sifting military court martial data   We know one  Kelley  decided shoot church  The problem runs deeper poor record keeping  Federal law prohibits anyone convicted domestic violence subject domestic violence restraining order owning gun  But spotty enforcement allow abusers fall cracks  While 28 states Washington  D C  laws prohibiting convicted domestic batterers buying possessing firearms  14 require give guns already own  Some laws say domestic violence restrictions apply spouse  cohabitating partner co parent  creating so called boyfriend loophole excludes casual partners  There three main background check databases reporting crimes  states differ report cases  Some states  like New York  New Mexico Louisiana  reported thousands domestic violence restraining orders National Instant

massacre  Texas officials called  domestic situation  Which isn t surprising either  A majority mass shootings 2009 2016 involved domestic family violence  according analysis gun violence prevention group Everytown Gun Safety  The group found 54  incidents four people  not including shooter  killed firearm  intimate partner family member among victims  Most mass shootings happened home  But TIME

Just mass shooters often abusers doesn t mean abusers likely mass shooters  That s red flags appear hindsight  researchers lack sufficient evidence prove connection ahead time   Right don t enough data pattern  says Susan B  Sorenson  professor University Pennsylvania director Ortner Center Family Violence  Gun rights advocates use uncertainty argue tougher restrictions gun access domestic abusers unnecessary  But logic doesn t hold either   The one thing know  mass shooters  common access massive firepower  says Sorensen   That s single unifying force  Keeping guns domestic abusers

A shooter s mind unsolvable riddle  nobody predict odd loner turn sociopath  angry outburst presages massacre  But hindsight  often red flags  Devin Patrick Kelley displayed plenty them  He mental health problems  history animal cruelty domestic violence conviction prevented getting gun  But got one anyway  Actually  got four  On Nov  5  Kelley  26  drove First Baptist Church tiny Sutherland Springs  Texas  wife s family worshipped  He fired assault style rifle congregation full children grandparents  killing 26 people injuring 20 more  Survivors said prowled aisle looking shoot crying babies mothers huddled pews  Among dead  toddler  pastor s daughter  two first time attendees unborn child  It massacre could never predicted  But perhaps could prevented  Like convicted domestic abusers  Kelley supposed access firearms  But Air Force acknowledged wake shooting appeared Kelley s domestic violence conviction wasn t entered National Crime Information Center  NCIC  database  likely able pass background check  This hardly isolated error  According Florida International University report obtained TIME  military mishandled roughly 1 300 domestic violence cases 2004 2012  including misclassifications allowed abusers go unreported NCIC   There thousands cases misclassified  says Eric Carpenter  associate professor FIU former Army lawyer spent years sifting military court martial data   We know one  Kelley  decided shoot church  The problem runs deeper poor record keeping  Federal law prohibits anyone convicted domestic violence subject domestic violence restraining order owning gun  But spotty enforcement allow abusers fall cracks  While 28 states Washington  D C  laws prohibiting convicted domestic batterers buying possessing firearms  14 require give guns already own  Some laws say domestic violence restrictions apply spouse  cohabitating partner co parent  creating so called boyfriend loophole excludes casual partners  There three main background check databases reporting crimes  states differ report cases  Some states  like New York  New Mexico Louisiana  reported thousands domestic violence restraining orders National Instant Criminal Background Check System Indices  NICS Indices  December 2016  33 states reported none all  Mourners gathered Nov  6 prayer service 26 victims Sutherland Springs Scott Olson Getty Images

Later year  pleaded guilty domestic violence charges spent year brig receiving  bad conduct  discharge Air Force  Once out  Kelley didn t clean act  In 2013  Comal County sheriff s office investigated complaint rape sexual assault New Braunfels  Texas  Kelley never charged  When lived Colorado 2014  neighbors called police witnessed beating dog  cited animal cruelty  That year  sheriffs responded domestic violence call Kelley s home checked girlfriend  left without filing charges  That girlfriend  Danielle Shields  became wife soon afterward  In recent months  Kelley s social media accounts grown darker  He lost job security guard July  It seemed like going romantic breakup  He posted pictures guns online  He sent threatening texts mother in law  It church Sutherland Springs targeted massacre  Texas officials called  domestic situation  Which isn t surprising either  A majority mass shootings 2009 2016 involved domestic family violence  according analysis gun violence prevention group Everytown Gun Safety  The group found 54  incidents four people  not including shooter  killed firearm  intimate partner family member among victims  Most mass shootings happened home  But TIME analysis Everytown s data found 46 mass shootings took place entirely public since 2009  33  shooters reported history violence women  James Hodgkinson  injured Republican Representative Steve Scalise Louisiana several others opened fire congressional baseball practice June  arrested 2006 hitting choking foster daughter  Omar Mateen  killed 49 people Pulse nightclub massacre Orlando 2016  abused ex

Just mass shooters often abusers doesn t mean abusers likely mass shooters  That s red flags appear hindsight  researchers lack sufficient evidence prove connection ahead time   Right don t enough data pattern  says Susan B  Sorenson  professor University Pennsylvania director Ortner Center Family Violence  Gun rights advocates use uncertainty argue tougher restrictions gun access domestic abusers unnecessary  But logic doesn t hold either   The one thing know  mass shooters  common access massive firepower  says Sorensen   That s single unifying force  Keeping guns domestic abusers rare subject Republicans Democrats mostly agree   There enormous problems background check system  says Senator John Cornyn Texas  Republican Senator Jeff Flake teaming Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich introduce bill would require military accurately record report domestic violence convictions  And Republican governors Utah  North Dakota  Wisconsin Michigan taken steps limit gun rights domestic batterers  Experts say laws require abusers surrender guns particularly effective  States implemented relinquishment laws saw 14  decline intimate partner gun homicides  according researchers

former head Wells Fargo  Or Equifax  If I sound cynical  it s consumers owe debt gratitude Richard Cordray  announced Wednesday he s stepping end month director CFPB  Trump Republican lawmakers long characterized Cordray enemy people   bureaucrat run amok  imposing autocratic gentle  kindhearted businesses want compete freely fairly people s patronage   They ve saying he s disaster  agency catastrophe  years years  said Lisa Donner  executive director advocacy group Americans Financial Reform   And people don t understand bureau might believe that   But describe bureau s work people  told me   they overwhelmingly support it  For instance  The CFPB fined Wells Fargo  100 million bank opened unauthorized accounts behalf millions customers  It fined Citigroup  28 8 million failing inform homeowners ways avoid foreclosure  It fined credit agency Experian  3 million deceiving people value credit scores  The bureau announced earlier month  9 million worth checks mail compensate 14 000 African American Latino borrowers unlawfully charged higher interest higher broker fees mortgage loans Provident Funding Associates  Days later  CFPB filed lawsuit company called Freedom Debt Relief  nation s largest debt settlement services provider  The suit alleges Freedom charges consumers without settling debts  misleads fees fails inform rights  In total  bureau estimates returned  12 billion consumers six years it s operating  That s drives financial firms completely bonkers  It s new federal agency dedicated solely protecting consumers unfair  predatory illegal practices  So they ve prodded Republican friends Capitol Hill something it  Those lawmakers  turn  produced various pieces legislation running gamut crippling CFPB s regulatory authority completely away agency  I sat Cordray visited Los Angeles months ago  I asked bothered critics blatantly misrepresent bureau s accomplishments  He replied  always does  critics free say like  His job watch consumers  backs   People entitled to  deserve  someone make sure markets fair transparent  Cordray told me   There s need agency  And there s work do  He said email CFPB staffers Wednesday  we made real lasting difference improved people s lives   I trust new leadership see value also work preserve   perhaps different ways before  desiring  I done  serve ways benefit strengthen economy country  Cordray optimistic I am  It seems likely Trump appoint someone consumer watchdog name only  someone prove valued friend industries tasked overseeing  One scary thought  Rep  Jeb Hensarling  Texas Republican chairs House Financial Services Committee  He announced last month won t seek reelection 2018   A number people world said could angling CFPB job  said Donner Americans Financial Reform  Hensarling author Financial Choice Act  would  among things  allow president fire CFPB director will  rather current standard bureau chief must found guilty  inefficiency  neglect duty malfeasance office  It would strip bureau authority monitor day to day activities financial firms prohibit cracking practices deemed unfair  deceptive abusive  The bill also would shut bureau s database consumer complaints  contains 700 000 searchable listings   I can t good James Brown  I feel good  Hensarling said Republican colleagues Financial Services Committee cast votes favor Financial Choice Act May  Again  CFPB

according recent study World Wildlife Fund  Humans blame Earth s previous mass extinctions often associated sudden  cataclysmic natural events  abrupt changes climate  massive volcanic eruptions

program  Our Student Voices columnists high school college students writing education issues matter them  Know student story tell school  Email Education Lab s engagement editor  Dahlia Bazzaz  dbazzaz seattletimes com  A week election  man wearing Make America Great Again hat walked journalism class  thought joke  It s rare see anyone openly Republican Roosevelt High School Northeast Seattle  With Hillary Clinton winning three times votes Donald Trump King County  it s surprise election results devastated many Roosevelt students  Students showed school black clothing  saying mourning loss intelligence country  Some tears  hugging holding hallways  My school total three walkouts large portion school participating  included  So journalism teacher invited Forest Machala   22 year old Trump supporter former Roosevelt student   visit class  surprised  say least   Everyone funk  shock  from election    I thought would good opportunity talk   someone honestly openly walked Roosevelt red hat on  said Christine Roux  journalism teacher  Machala equally excited opportunity  One reasons Roosevelt day see handling election  Before discussion began  Ms  Roux told us could leave weren t comfortable  half class left work assignments  I devastated election I supported Clinton  I wasn t sure I could handle talking Trump supporter  But curiosity outweighed fears I decided stay   I heard Machala say faith Trump didn t falter release Access Hollywood tape  shows Trump making misogynist comments women  I upset  I run room calm down  After minutes deep breaths  I realized felt strongly beliefs I mine I respect him  Growing Cuban American family  I always heard value free speech  Throughout childhood  I influenced Fidel Castro piatas birthday parties stories American dream  I taught free speech privilege  Cuba  privilege limited  I think that s I struggle intolerance  especially it s intolerant one  We lucky right free speech  No matter hard is  always honor other s voices  I returned continued participate conversation  The next day class  spent time talking Machala s visit  There many different feelings expressed  common thread shock  Nobody ever talked anyone like before  That surprised me  I never realized little political diversity school  opened eyes fact probably students who  like Machala  loyal Trump afraid speak up  In months followed  I started notice one sidedness class discussions peers using word Republican insult  I think behavior harmful  As teenagers  political opinions constantly changing  Every high school foster safe environment students learn grow politically  And start fundamental level   encouraging respectful conversations  Xing Gilbert  senior organized two walkouts  said it s important students voice views   It shows people parts country  city  students upset  students like don t agree current leadership  said  Yet I ll always supporter student voice  I think careful aren t suppressing another person s right speak  I ve seen liberal peers shutting viewpoints  This OK  It s important people engage conversations  It s way move political gridlock  Unfortunately  many students Seattle  it s hard even get opportunity talk someone opposing views  At Roosevelt  tensions Republicans Democrats reached boiling point  Friendships broken fifty posters advertising school s Republican club ripped down  Many Republicans Roosevelt ended feeling even isolated afraid speak out  To clear  liberal students also targets political bullying school settings  Directly election  Republican students shouting  Build wall  Detroit cafeterias students taunting classmates yelling  Trump  Kentucky  There legitimate reasons students concerned outcome election  But school  didn t matter views skewed slightly right   people would assume Trump supporter   It s divided country right now  schools going reflect tension  said Ian Malcolm  AP Comparative Government teacher Roosevelt  One student felt tension junior Maddy Hoffman  Leading election  Hoffman interviewed student newspaper support Trump  In article  Hoffman talked belief stricter immigration thinks put American jobs first  She expected people react negatively views said frustrating see unwelcoming students days article came out   In hallways school   someone  I didn t even know would pass yelling  Make America Great Again   Build wall  It like harassment  Hoffman said  The two students started Roosevelt s Republican Club similar experience  One said co president assaulted school gym students heard talking Republican politics  Roosevelt administrators confirmed physical altercation take place assembly  The situation resulted school based discipline  Some teachers weren t helping matters  Six students told teachers belittled Trump supporters handed fliers walkout election  I think teachers  Roosevelt  need make sure don t assume audience liberal  entertain perspectives  create classroom environment strikes balance respect free speech   If teachers   create culture intolerance classroom failing job basically  They need make sure everyone voice classroom  said Malcolm  Luckily  students school determined making sure diverse voices heard  Hoffman  example  made mission promote political tolerance  Through club  Debate Society  encourages respectful conversations  Clubs like Political Discussion Club Republican Club ethos  Antonio Zacco  rising senior one leaders Political Discussion Club  said it s important students  soon nation s leaders  regularly talk people differing views  Following election  Political Discussion Club Republican Club participated open debate similar one journalism class  In meeting  discussed immigration policy tied current events  Both leaders say discussion went well planned future  Going senior year  I hope encourage respectful robust debates classes maybe participate several new clubs  Although clubs starting change climate Roosevelt  students may found solution   simply listening

elementary school also took lives 26 innocent people  including six year old son Dylan 19 first grade classmates  The pain loss  especially senseless preventable act gun violence  every day  also compels find deliver solutions help prevent future loss life  Unfortunately  country deal loss life gun violence far often  It become rampant  epidemic country experiences  Two five deadliest US shootings modern history happened last 35 days  After every mass shooting  I hear arguments become familiar since Sandy Hook  Some argue  gun control   gun freedom  Others like aren t arguing gun  rather focusing person behind gun violent actions could prevented  As quickly debate guns starts  ends  These horrific attacks fade news headlines quickly  told  Now time talk gun violence  The time

health conditions much likely victims violence perpetrate it  likely hurt rather hurt others  In fact  mental illness contributes less 6  gun violence  The truth mismanaged uninterrupted fear anger  coupled nearly unfettered access guns happened Texas  sadly mass shootings  It s fear anger often escalates point person sees path ahead except self harm violence others  Often  shooters give warning signs either missed  misunderstood  ignored  These tragedies could prevented someone recognized signs made intervention  We know shooter Sutherland Springs jailed assault wife child  sent threatening

Texas  whether records correctly sent NICS  Once again  signs signals missed   another preventable tragedy  Citizens alone lot within community know signs take action intervene violence takes place  But also much federal state legislation prevent violence  I asking you  Mr President  use influence create meaningful sustainable solutions  You  along Congress  power save lives thousands Americans make country safe again  You power nationalize intervention programs train youth adults recognize signs signals individuals at risk violence  You also means put pressure states comply laws help protect citizens  Extreme Risk Protection Orders  ERPOs  one way protect families communities gun violence  With ERPOs place  family members local law enforcement support someone adjudicated at risk others   case domestic violence  suicide homicide   temporarily remove access firearms block attempted purchases longer risk  ERPOs proven save lives protect due process second amendment rights  ERPOs established successfully managed several states including California  Oregon  Washington Connecticut  Extreme Risk Protection Orders legislation Republicans Democrats can  should  support  The federal government everything encourage states enact legislation that s proven save lives  using carrot stick federal grant money  Historically  president Congress wanted mandate national safety rules  like highway speed limit minimum drinking age  used power purse  making funding contingent states taking certain actions  So  government serious combatting gun violence  put influence money is  Use federal public safety grants   like highway law enforcement funding   carrot incentivize states pass ERPOs  In end  everyone wins   federal government gets states wants  states get money need  people s lives saved commonsense law  There proof approach worked ensure state compliance  save lives  In 1974  president Congress set national speed limit 55 miles per hour  road fatalities declined 16 4  one year  In 1984  Congress proposed cutting 10  federal highway funds states comply new national drinking age 21  President Reagan said   In case like this  problem clearcut benefits clearcut  I misgivings judicious use federal inducements encourage states get moving  raise drinking age  save precious lives  According NIH  drunk driving accidents dropped 50  since law passed  Please  Mr President  Refuse accept national tragedies norm America  Refuse stop progress prevention remaining silent  Refuse part endless debate goes nowhere leaves death grieving families every day  Help stop gun

research shows swaddled babies roll stomach double risk SIDS compared unswaddled baby rolling over  As result  pediatrics academy recommending parents stop baby wrapping 2 months  On face it  group s

ignited firestorm controversy last spring and though later clarified meant  never really backed down   I think people frightened saying think  I think that s bad thing society  told The Atlantic s national correspondent Ta Nehisi Coates editor chief Jeffrey Goldberg Paris recently   The problems left interest I think there s increase in intolerance  maybe putting simply but there s feeling you re supposed conform  The left  Adichie says  longer actually liberal   There s language you re supposed use  said   There s orthodoxy you re supposed conform to  don t  become bad  evil person  doesn t matter you ve done past stand for  Related Story Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie When Language Fails Her Adichie thinks deeply identity work  As author divided time U S  Nigeria career  often weaves transatlantic perspective writing  notably 2013 s Americanah  In conversation Goldberg Coates  Adichie described complexities race brought sharper relief whenever comes States  When she s Nigeria  she s  black  way America  color skin immediately changes seen treated   There s particular kind asshole ry white people reserve black people  says   You tell  You always tell  It s subtle thing  Still  says   there is  me  black woman  African woman  sense possibility America I don t feel I m Europe  Perhaps that s Adichie says she s surprised perceives deference among Americans power Donald Trump wields president  Coates  part  isn t shocked   For black folks born raised America  deference power very  familiar  It s part feels American he s Paris United States  says  An edited transcript conversation  recorded Paris first episode The Atlantic s new podcast  The Atlantic Interview  below  Jeffrey Goldberg  Let s start something happened airport  You said kind bad experience coming Paris  Chimamanda Adichie  So I present Nigerian passport  I have  I American green card  Nigerian passport  And man  immigration man in sort haughty thin faced French way looks visa says me   This Spain  Why here  And I said   Well I ve Spain it s Schengen visa  I use France  And says   Where return ticket  He doesn t ask I m here  So I give return ticket  And point people watching us  people spent minute  getting through  point I 10  So total I 30 minutes  standing there  would ignore turn around mumble something colleague turn back I d like   Is something wrong  Can tell what s wrong  And would completely ignore make really annoying Gallic gesture  sort shruggy thing  But really power play  What saying is  You re welcome here  And didn t reason saying I everything  I valid visa  I everything I needed person coming country doesn t resources  means seen people stay countries like this  But I also remember thinking  I American green card  Why hell I want stay France  Goldberg  Are ever tempted say   I MacArthur Genius prize  Do ever want play  don t you know who I am  card  I mean  it s obnoxious sense  But woman achievement and  I m curious  ever tempting you  Adichie  No  I think maybe part pique rage  maybe comes sense privilege  is  Oh  nobody treats like this  I feel I don t somebody treated dignity  right  Because I m thinking  Why can t polite  Why can t answer question  Why can t damned job  But there s long history people coming Africa  Europe treated like this  So I don t think I m unusual  Goldberg  Can compare contrast African experience  I hate use broad term African let s say West African experience Europe versus United States  Adichie  Ooh  much time have  Okay  I think I talk U S  authority  I guess I like America  I know America many problems  But is  black woman  African woman  sense possibility America I don t feel I m Europe  particularly continental Europe  I like U K  No  I like London  The rest U K    Goldberg  You could without  Adichie  It s interesting  But  know  Goldberg  But U K  ever feel burden colonial history you  Adichie  In America  I feel black rubbish comes it  So I became black America  Goldberg  Right  Adichie  In Nigeria  I wasn t black  I didn t think black  When I go back home now  I go back Nigeria now  I get plane Lagos I don t think race  I get plane arrive Atlanta  immediately I m aware race  I mean know  it s interesting thing race becomes possible reason things way that  Goldberg   like Charles de Gaulle Airport now  Adichie  Exactly  So somebody asshole Nigeria  many people are  I think  they re  bad day  They re assholes  They don t like me  Right  If happens U S  things  I m thinking also they re racist  Goldberg  But that s interesting  I conversation I think Ta Nehisi maybe people   assumption you re minority  you re person color  something goes wrong interaction person white  there s assumption fear suspicion it s race based  And truth matter white people often assholes white people  And it s interesting especially racially fraught moment like we re in  America  everybody goes right single point explanation things  Adichie  You know though  Yes  white people assholes white people  But I think there s something said particular kind asshole ry  There s particular kind asshole ry white people reserve black people  I think though I  Because often black person says   This racist I think America happens quite bit you re told   Oh  oh surely wasn t racist  And I m thinking  well black person inherited this I m going dramatic say trauma really I think so  You know  don t want racist  When things happen U S  I suspect it s racist and it doesn t something massive  It somebody doesn t extend dignity courtesy you  tell would different white person  You tell  And times white person nasty I ve known wasn t race  I mean  I dealt grumpy old white men I sense everybody  But tell  You always tell  It s subtle thing    When I came U S  I didn t really know it s something know  It s something comes dark skin  It s something comes living country that s racist  So  lived U S  while  I started understand subtleties  I started know race  I didn t I first got there  But I guess point is  I don t think black people quick rush race reason I don t think black people want race  You know I mean  I feel like I don t want racist things happen  So I point happen  it s I enjoy it  I would rather weren t happening  Actually  like people bad day nasty way would anybody else  But tell  You tell it s race   We talk about  U S  working class though it s somehow uniformly white  Ta Nehisi Coates  I think she s quite correct that  And I think whole notion like extra level comes it  Like somebody might general asshole  But extra level condescension something it  I think also bigger thing is  she s correct I d rather  racism  Like  I d much much rather would be  I say and I want clear African American  black Parisian  black French person  somebody coming Martinique  somebody coming Senegal Algeria as African American  One things I get people assholes  I know they re assholes  They don t like Americans I know that  that s okay  fine  Goldberg  Does make feel like American  Coates  Yes  Goldberg  More Paris America  Do feel American  Coates  Yes  Yes  Except Obama got elected  Adichie  I want talk women I like women  particular  I mean  men okay  women thing  So I taken aback learn 53 percent white women voted Trump  And reason I surprised I assumed majority women would vote person   it s person boasts assaulting women person clearly doesn t really think women equals  And I realized voted white women also white  White women women  they re also white  And I think it s whiteness  I think lot Trump s campaigning coded  It coded language race  It whole idea  make America great again  And strong anti immigration positions  sort caricatures Mexicans  And I think lot whiteness and  strange sort way  I understand white women would find appealing  Goldberg  What understand  Adichie  I think humans  change something worries us  And I think people imagine it doesn t necessarily even true that sort catastrophic change coming  And I think black man president suddenly black people positions power  You know  attorney general black man I think people upsetting  Even people voted Obama I think many that  suddenly they re like  Wait  hold on  And I sort imagine white person saying  They re taking now  many black people positions power  I see would see threatening sense America supposed be  That kind thing  There s kind entitlement comes whiteness America  I think white people   I mean  so  they re talking question economics  Never mind people money voted Trump  even that  I keep thinking  don t talk minority working class  We talk about  U S  working class though it s somehow uniformly white  And black people I know working class U S because I asked all  seven them and none voted Trump  And economic problems  they  too  feel left out  And I think question becomes  Why  Why didn t vote Trump  Because Trump selling magical idea of  know  bring back coal mines  everything s going perfect  didn t vote him  And I think makes strong case whiteness part Trump s whole schtick   Today there s increase self righteousness  there s also sense speak everyone  Goldberg  You surprised events last year  Adichie  I been  I think it s much worse I imagined would it s made realize incredibly fragile democracy is  There things I used think would never happen America  When you re place like Nigeria  it s common people say   know  spend time criticizing government somebody like   Go America  They never that  Right  That never happen America  And I ve realized can  Goldberg  You interesting experience growing constantly changing military dictatorships  How bad think could get  Adichie  Oh  I think get bad  Goldberg  Even America  Adichie  Yes  it s already bad  I mean  anybody ever think would country people would go airports pretty much arrested  There s much going U S  feels banana republic y me  And I think get worse    I used think Americans wouldn t bow power way done  I ve taken aback journalism covered Trump  people argue say lied  Yes  lied  But I think power presidency really   I didn t realize much awe Americans were  Goldberg  You didn t think deference American habit  Adichie  Yes  Deference certain kind political power  I didn t think so  No  Goldberg  So  going back campaign  say yourself   That reminds something I saw Nigeria  Was anything specific sort triggered specific memory  Adichie  I think first shock travel ban uncertainty people had    So woman came Nigeria valid visa turned away  suddenly brother in law  U S  citizen physician Connecticut  wanted go back Nigeria two weeks sister said him   Don t go  Don t go don t know  might let back in  Don t go  And made think   there s certain uncertainty living military dictatorship I remember I maybe 8 9  talk coup going happen father supposed go Europe mother said him   Don t go Lagos  Don t go don t know what s going happen  And I kind felt watching TV coverage travel ban  I thought   I can t believe America  It felt sadly familiar  Coates  That s difference African African American experience  I can t believe isn t happening America African American sense  It s black sense you re coming Africa America s distant thing  much like probably lot things I would say France  A black French person would look like   Well think coming into  So it s interesting hear  For black folks born raised America  deference power very  familiar  Our ancestral heartland south  I mean  became democratic 1960s within living memory lot people  It s different  Adichie  No  I completely get that  I know that  I ve often thought time black Americans sort step aside sidewalk white person could walk past  black African was you know  well could get scholarship go Cambridge Oxford  When black Americans weren t allowed basic human dignity America black  Africa  particularly sort privileged classes  charge destinies  I think things go generations I know worldview would different I American born    My grandfather actually nearly sold slavery  No  great grandfather  There s story family rejected wound leg was thank God wound but happened maybe I would be  I don t know  Brazilian African American  I think entire view America would different  Very different   We need find way culture start believing women  Goldberg  One many interesting things intolerance impatience jargon groupthink periodically get kind useful trouble speaking mind  It s fair say you re associated liberal worldview  seem little bit frustrated lately sort this I don t know would call it Darwinian process winnowing people sound heterodoxical  Is fair  Adichie  The problems left interest I think there s increase in intolerance  maybe putting simply but there s feeling you re supposed conform  It longer opinion actually liberal  There s language you re supposed use  There s orthodoxy you re supposed conform to  don t  become bad  evil person  doesn t matter you ve done past stand for  You become evil you re demonized  makes uncomfortable I think it s problematic many ways  I think people frightened saying think  I think that s bad thing society  Goldberg  They re frightened say think  But sometimes group thing directed legitimate reasons offended  Adichie  I m person believes strongly ideas inclusion hearing everybody s story sort thing  And need hear  I also   I think it s easy say answer bad speech speech  general I think so  Part problem  I think  censoring sometimes there s ever so slight assumption thing might true  Goldberg  And think it s coming from  Adichie  My sense American left 50 years ago wasn t like this  People still believed inclusion  Today there s increase self righteousness  there s also sense speak everyone  So write white woman  many parts left it s valid criticism say ignored Mexicans Bangladeshis  And I m thinking  No  People allowed tell story  I don t necessarily want white woman telling Nigerian woman story  And maybe it s coming knowing left not  fact  inclusive thinks is  And that  I think people allowed stage few the grand stage gets decide  Goldberg   acceptable speech  The boundaries acceptable speech  Adichie  Yes  And maybe answer shut things down  But I don t want to  I think lot well meaning  I think young people college campuses trying get acknowledgment power  So it s thing Puerto Rican writing somebody Dominican Republic they re kind level powerlessness  And I also think you re I think I know lot whiteness white people know blackness  Goldberg  And according even rigorous rules gets say member a  relatively speaking   powerless  community  try inhabit life member majority community would quite interesting anyway  I m giving assignment  I think would great novel  I d buy it  Coates  There s also long history white people us badly  Adichie  Very badly  Coates  I m fan people able write people respectfully  I love Ragtime  Coalhouse Walker  Goldberg  Right  Doctorow successful job writing  historical fiction featuring black characters early 20th century America  Coates  Yeah  Ragtime s great  But very  respectful experience  anybody s experience you re writing it  Unfortunately African Americans and certainly Africans American culture  long history presented people fashion is  shall say  least respectful  So baggage comes it  When gets refracted through   Who right  question I would encourage asked  but that s context place  Goldberg  My point I want writers write whatever want write about  Adichie  So I  So I  Goldberg  But I hate idea space closed anybody wants write anything anything  Adichie  It s strange thing  though  there s two sides it  So  one hand I think course anybody write want  I think friend Dave Eggers so Dave wrote book guy Sudan called What Is What  And I thought well done  And Dave white male  guy wrote black African  It s can t done  It simply Ta Nehisi said well there s history  And it s there s history  It s also  I mean when I say I know lot whiteness white people know blackness  it s I m necessarily interested whiteness  It s I live world  so  steeped whiteness  don t choice  So I know lot white women s hair women s magazines white women s hair  But white friends know little hair don t know  And course  America America  liberals well meaning nobody asks anything they re really well meaning  Goldberg  Going back point everybody scared actually ask stuff  Adichie  Yeah  I don t mind  I m like  Ask me  I ll tell don t know  So woman said once   Oh  Your dreads lovely  I said her   No  I don t dreads  They re braids ,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

help health housing problems  Lenny I drove south city together  roads lined RVs strewn trash  Seattle lately strained rising homelessness heroin addiction  Last year  record 359 people died Seattle drug overdoses  The majority involved opioids heroin prescription painkillers  Working city s economically fragile addicts made Lenny skeptical typical rhetoric addiction that moral failing  choice  users want treatment  addicts funneled swiftly rehab  At rehab  might required  admit  junkie  detox might die  turn life God  said  That works people  others spin treatment end right back streets

lifesaving   If you re dead  can t receive treatment  said   There value things horrible  An opponent brought property crime  argument safe injection sites draw criminals   We re even addressing that  Toward end  things took loopy turn  one man parodied arguments anti safe injection crowd   You ban airbags seatbelts encourage people drive dangerous way  said   I don t evidence  You don t need

 Amy  deaths expected   That s happens  told me  Still  opposes safe injection sites   My concern   say   We re going make easy  we re going make safe  subtly saying   This okay  said   There value things horrible  Five King County cities around Seattle swiftly moved ban safe consumption sites  In four  vote unanimous  Joshua Freed  city councilman nearby city Bothell  others introduced ballot

16  judge block initiative  Freed appealing decision  If Bothell councilman successful  King County Council plans draw initiative calling creation two safe injection sites an initiative would ballot alongside Freed s anti safe consumption measure  according The Seattle Times  After county council meeting  I sat coffee Freed Jalair Box  resident opponent safe consumption sites  They argue facilities would catch tiny fraction users inject drugs Seattle given day  Worse  said  tantamount legalizing heroin  Most all  Box fears sites won t enough help addicts get treatment  She upset possibility person  walking drug consumption site deciding   I m done  I want out  I want treatment  person behind counter saying   I m sorry  don t treatment today  here s booth   That sends chills me  said  This common fear among opponents so called harm reduction approaches  Lawrence County southern Indiana  example  recently discontinued needle exchange program similar concerns   Few  any  health care professionals I personally spoke believe needle exchange program effective way getting people treatment programs  Lawrence County Council Member Rodney Fish told NBC News  King County officials told that  addition safe use sites  working expand overall access full slate drug treatment services  on demand  Currently  city offers opioid addicts heroin withdrawal medications methadone buprenorphine  residential treatment  within couple days week  To Freed Box  that s enough   We don t enough resources allocated treatment  Freed said   Why spend  the safe injection money  treatment  That s heart  What enabling people use heroin legalizing and  truly  making accessible  Freed also worries sites would become magnets crime  I told I planned visit Insite  Vancouver  Canada  safe injection site operating since 2003  following day  Freed  taken several trips Insite s neighborhood  detailed shady characters met there  people shooting street  woman  angered Freed s companion took picture  began stabbing wall knife  women selling hit   gentleman  tattoos face  Freed urged go alone   I wouldn t let wife go herself  said   It s dark place  I get concerned single gal like going yourself  I wouldn t  end  get go inside Insite  They d much media interest late  declined let yet another reporter stomp around inside is  all  health care facility  I decided I d still check neighborhood later afternoon  But first  I drove Surrey  city southeast Vancouver population half million  There  administrators safe injection site  SafePoint  opened past June  agreed give predawn tour premises  SafePoint looks like run of the mill trailer  It abuts tent city rife drug use  800 clients homes families  Sex workers come use go night  Some people come return recovery homes  Once inside  addicts provide moniker anonymity take clean needles supplies need  In supply area  there s even bin marked  flavored condoms oral sex  I asked Fraser Mackay  manages site  free   We re universal health care  said  tone Daddy Warbucks might used explain Little Orphan Annie longer mop floors   These citizens entitled health care needs have  Inside  users sat one seven booths  snorted injected drugs normally would  Most SafePoint clients heroin meth  goods usually laced much deadlier fentanyl  They aren t allowed pass drugs booths help inject  There s clinic next door clients get treatment sores medical problems often accompany long term drug use  start methadone  If person overdoses  happens two three times per day  SafePoint staffers tip chair back administer naloxone revive them  They ve deaths far  don t harangue people get treatment  The staff  very engaging  friendly  accessible  Mackay said   we can t badgering people ready  When little windows opening  use those   So they re like   Man  I wish I could quit    I said  probing example  window   The staff would that  said  He would send detox facility outpatient clinic could start get clean right away  I asked many people gone treatment SafePoint far   Not many  said   I d say handful   Later  Victoria Lee  chief medical officer Fraser Health Authority  health organization runs SafePoint  estimated 10 percent SafePoint users enter treatment  A pale  middle aged man staggered trailer  used heroin  He would give name Glen  He coming SafePoint since opened  likes feeling comfort safety provides  I asked SafePoint staffers ever pressure get treatment  felt like should   That pushes people away  said  Besides  already treatment  liked  I learned lot myself  But started using anyway  I ducked rain awning nearby building  There  I met Karen Scott  55 year old former user clean  Soon going start peer counselor SafePoint  I explained I United States  safe consumption sites controversial appear divert attention away getting addicts treatment   You can t force someone treatment  said   If they re willing themselves  aren t going end staying   Why would someone ready  I asked   People addiction want they ve trauma lives  Scott said   Every time trauma feeling starts coming up  want stuff back don t feel pain  Some people think trauma bad won t able deal  without drugs  Scott got clean one point and  relapsed because   I never worked trauma got addiction first place  said  With help mindful meditation  made peace abusive past  Now  she s able resist temptation much lives apartment block away SafePoint  heart Surrey s drug zone  This seemed common theme among active recovered addicts I met Canada elsewhere  Though start using fun lark  most  inner turmoil underpinned substance use  As Lenny  outreach worker Seattle  put me  people quit   they start dealing feelings  problems  And treatment doesn t really help that  From Surrey  I drove Insite Vancouver hung sidewalk front building hours  While quite parade horrors Freed promised  also seem like picture happy harm reduction  Next guy selling cellphone chargers folding table  one man shot heroin sidewalk  another walked asked  jim local slang speed  While I there  sort commotion corner  police quickly cordoned area  The word street someone got stabbed  Defenders safe consumption sites say Vancouver neighborhood already like this  even Insite came scene  It s low income area whose climate temperate  Canadian standards makes appealing homeless people  Studies Insite found helped reduce overdose deaths  research shown safe injection sites general don t raise crime rates lead drug trafficking  One study noted use Insite  has also associated increased uptake detoxification services   Box  safe injection site opponent Seattle  disputed studies biased  says places like Insite don t track long term treatment outcomes well  The Insite clients I spoke with most would give first names monikers heroin remains illegal were belligerent  They seemed grateful  One 22 year old  fresh using meth Insite  said treatment several times   I never said I don t want go back  said  But   I m ready deal real life  A 21 year old devil horn headband scars arms said likes Insite  it s safe place don t get busted cops  She said  emotional issues  attachment issues  keep going treatment  Heroin  said   makes everything disappear  Insite doesn t pressure go treatment   They re really tell this  tell that  said   When I m ready  I ll know I m ready  When I told don t safe consumption sites United

it s enough  probably one 30 people  Still  addiction experts doubt whether it s even possible spur people even have  every definition  hit  rock bottom to kick habit  Families want encourage loved one get treatment attend support groups set limits they re willing tolerate  said Linda Rosenberg  president National Council Behavioral Health  But  added   the belief everyone ready go treatment  isn t true  The guidance National Institute Drug Abuse similarly states   There evidence confrontational  interventions  like familiar TV programs effective convincing people problem motivating change  It even possible confrontational encounters escalate violence backfire ways   There stages motivation  beginning someone interested all  Rosenberg said   They don t want face pain lives they re high
