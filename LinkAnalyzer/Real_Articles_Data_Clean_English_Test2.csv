brutality terror war  And that s   there s lot book  But particular incident also  I think  highlights things see war particularly ignorance self deception lot military commanders  So that s I like   gets detail big picture  So we ll get that  But I want start talking young woman  18 year old young woman Viet Cong fighter Hue area  Her name Che Thi Mung  BOWDEN  Right  DAVIES  Tell us her  committed Viet Cong  BOWDEN  Well  18 year old village girl  Her family fought independence Viet Minh years earlier  Her grandfather arrested  Her father spent time jail  DAVIES  The Viet Minh fought French occupied  BOWDEN  Right  DAVIES   Indochina  50s  BOWDEN  In 1950s  And were  know  14 years later  A new generation fighting   time Americans  perceived foreigners  invaders trying rule Vietnamese people  Her older sister joined Viet Cong gotten killed  And sister killed  South Vietnamese came village rounded everyone related her  including Che  And Che taken interrogated  She waterboarded  basically  extremely proud fact told anything  She joined Viet Cong since sister s death  knew lot going village  You know  she s age little older I am  60s now  And she s still extremely proud endured given anything  DAVIES  In fall 1967  commanders came said  something big happening  BOWDEN  Right  DAVIES  We role you  What it  BOWDEN  And recruited 10 girls local villages  And idea move city Hue spy Americans South Vietnamese  And moved family lived center city  selling conical hats streets basically observed comings goings American troops compound  MACV Compound southern part city other  DAVIES  That s American military compound  yeah  BOWDEN  Right   other  know  military locations  So knew something big coming  But job observe report back every evening  DAVIES  Right  There would eventually invasion  would role guiding troops streets knew well  Let s talk little bit war 1968  combatants were  American military presence Vietnam  BOWDEN  Well  Lyndon Johnson really upped America s involvement war three years earlier  1965  playing role strictly advisers South Vietnamese troops actually waging war themselves  And 1968   actually  1967  half million American troops there  enormous American presence  I mean  Vietnam become  intents purposes  Vietnam colony  And  know  happened result tremendous investment really much  They slowed Viet Cong North Vietnamese  hadn t stopped them  And war really kind stalemate  even though general charge  General William Westmoreland  made trip United States late 1967 assured everybody victory really around corner  DAVIES  He trust confidence Lyndon Johnson  The president really believed Westmoreland telling him  BOWDEN  Right  DAVIES  One things saw area   stage war   American airpower used great ferocity impact  Why didn t work  What impact incredible level explosives dropped country  BOWDEN  Well  killing lot people  And definitely hurting North Vietnamese  But couldn t really stop Hanoi waging war they re   frankly    remember fake  great quote was   bomb back Stone Age  And agricultural society  It didn t big infrastructure  They targets  And one things pilots would complain sent bombing missions  And would bomb little bridge  three days later  would rebuilt back running  So would complain there  know  weren t many targets  And dangerous getting shot fairly alarming rate  So  know  I think   top generals  I think great deal frustration felt troops themselves  DAVIES  So situation South Vietnam  country anti communist government supporting  It s filled local fighters  Viet Cong  well North Vietnamese regulars communist led government Hanoi  They filtering down  fighting Americans time  And war kind stalemate  The North Vietnamese plan big offensive  game changer  What it  BOWDEN  Well  decided launch attacks every city South Vietnam  So North Vietnamese strategy infiltrate large numbers troops throughout South launch eve Tet  big holiday  attacks cities  The largest offensive planned Hue  DAVIES  And Hue held special place country s cultural history  Tell us it  BOWDEN  Well  it s   really beautiful city and  ages past  imperial seat unified country Vietnam  It had  know  citadel  giant fortress contained imperial palace  emperors used live reign  The city home major universities  In Vietnam  big Buddhist center also fairly large Catholic Center  It home lot intellectuals  And deep cultural meaning Vietnam that  I think  frankly escaped American command  DAVIES  And largely unmarred war  right  BOWDEN  That s right  Out   partly respect institutions Hue  historical treasures  Buddhist pagodas  imperial palace  Hue kind oasis  And troops stationed there  American troops  know  saw rear position  You know  weren t expecting shot encounter much hostility  DAVIES  Mark Bowden s new book  Hue 1968  A Turning Point In The American War In Vietnam  We ll continue conversation short break  This FRESH AIR   SOUNDBITE OF JOAN JEANRENAUD S  AXIS  DAVIES  This FRESH AIR  And we re speaking writer Mark Bowden  He   national correspondent The Atlantic contributing editor Vanity Fair  also author book  Black Hawk Down  His new book pivotal battle Vietnam War  Hue 1968  The Citadel  fort   Hue city 140 000 people  Half lived inside   it s maybe exactly would think fort  Describe little bit  BOWDEN  Well  it s enormous fortress encloses almost square mile  And said  densely populated  There nine entrances citadel  The walls 30  40 feet high 30 40 feet thick  There s moat way around it  It looks like something medieval  although actually built early 19th century  It s formidable structure  The Japanese took World War II  You know  relic another era  And go Hue  gives city kind ancient feel  DAVIES  The North Vietnamese army units Viet Cong wanted surprise Americans South Vietnamese  meant get lot arms troops position secretly  Explain that  BOWDEN  Stealthily  They recruited local people  And smuggled arms city duck boats  know  laying weapons ammunition underneath decks boats bringing way  The   also assemble  ultimately  10 000 troops  And North Vietnamese units spent months marching down  carrying heavy loads ammunitions supplies north mountain trails  Ho Chi Minh trail mountains outside city Hue  So   had  DAVIES  Just sort carrying backs hundreds miles  BOWDEN  Carrying backs   had  know  Viet Cong cadres would carry city arms ammunition  could stockpile warehouses full things knew anticipated would ferocious counterattack took city  And able hold for  know  long could  And knew they d need lot weapons supplies  And  know  interesting hear it  I mean  Americans carried meals ready eat  The Viet Cong carried  actually  live pigs treks  And would slaughter eat along trail  And would drug carried didn t make noise could move stealthily  This extraordinarily thorough  well thought out preparation went many months  It actually started summer 1967  So January  68  began  everything ready  DAVIES  So Viet Cong North Vietnamese moved thousands troops munitions position attack Hue  old imperial capital  hoping surprise Americans South Vietnamese  Did they  BOWDEN  Totally  They took city little actual fighting  They overcome guards entrances Citadel places  And instances  fairly significant firefights  But eve holiday Tet  South Vietnamese sent many troops home holidays years past  truce holidays  And last place expected big attack Hue  So guards gates Citadel overcome  invading troops took everything  marched right southern half city  populous Citadel  And it s modern kind government center Hue  They walked straight streets city took everything  By end of  like  four five hours  entire city except besieged South Vietnamese military post inside Citadel also small   we re talking maybe two  three block radius diameter   American base called MACV  Military Assistance Command Vietnam compound  maybe 300 400 American troops basically holed like Alamo  DAVIES  In city Hue  communist forces took over  And expected civilian population would rise support  finally drive American colonialists out  What experience  BOWDEN  Well  military units went city  political commissars  whose job was  took city  basically set new government city hunt punish people Hue worked allied Saigon regime  So two things going on  They setting up  know  revolutionary government    propagandists out  lecturing people megaphones  calling streets  And expected people would happily join war liberation turning neighbors    traitors eyes  working Americans South Vietnamese  DAVIES  And conscripted dig trenches   certainly expected American counterattack   provide food shelter troops  BOWDEN  Right  And  know  even told one point wanted   even though didn t arms people  wanted people take broomsticks paint black American forces arrived  would see united citizenry streets armed ready fight them  And this  course  madness  I mean  people living Hue saw horrified  And lot tried get out  DAVIES  OK  So   political education  There conscription service  How brutal purge  effect  believed cooperators  BOWDEN  It got worse worse  I mean  initially  egregious traitors executed  But  time  kind mob rule set in  And couple factors play  You had  I think  ideological fervor young idealists determined purge citizenry of  know  evil doers  And had  I think  growing frustration local people didn t expected and  I think  anger toward citizens Hue  And was  I think  opportunists took advantage opportunity get rid guy street angered one point another  And  know  vendettas  And ended hundreds thousands people marched executed  And I think violence perpetrated citizens Hue turned lot people Viet Cong North Vietnamese subsequent years  You know  disaster  I think  sides   North Vietnamese side American South Vietnamese side  DAVIES  You know  write book Viet Cong regarded many anti war activists United States freedom fighters  You say Viet Cong actually pretty vicious  BOWDEN  They were  And  know  plenty people like Che Thi Mung Nguyen Van Quang idealists   young idealists   fighting freedom country  DAVIES  She s 18 year old girl  He guy smuggled arms boats  BOWDEN  Yeah  And I think every bit well intentioned young Marines fighting them  But hardcore leadership North Vietnamese   North Vietnam Viet Cong   serious brutal revolutionaries determined punish opposed use fear tool  know  rally citizenry  And  know  time  DAVIES  Mark Bowden s book  Hue 1968  A Turning Point In The American War In Vietnam  After break  he

detailed account bloodiest single battle Vietnam War turning point conflict  Communist forces seized old imperial Vietnamese capital Hue 1968 part Tet Offensive  set coordinated surprise attacks cities throughout South Vietnam   SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST  DAVIES  You know  one things write deception self deception within American military  telling politicians they re winning war  side suffering many casualties  can t go on  Now  suddenly  imperial city  Hue  enemy s control  Did deception continue  How respond  BOWDEN  This frankly  Dave  one things surprised story  General Westmoreland inkling going happen and  fact  many times explained nothing like could happen simply   enemy lacked numbers troops  couldn t put sort position  And I get it  I mean  anyone faked war  But city taken  basically  American command refused believe happened  And wasn t public relations ploy  In cables Westmoreland commanders sending Washington  saying hundred Vietnamese sort dead enders holed city  And they ll chased day two  And led small units American Marines set attack huge   overwhelming force  well entrenched  And got slaughtered  And didn t happen once  It happened again  And even though young company commanders   captains   Hue informing superior officers overwhelming enemy force taken entire city  one would believe them  They continued try fight one sided  suicidal battle  And lot Americans got killed result  DAVIES  Yeah  There force came South chewed Vietnamese troops encountered  Then another sent North  And one units trapped  surrounded North Vietnamese fighters  included soldier read beginning  He trapped foxhole  watching mortars rain soldiers  What happened unit came North  BOWDEN  Well  battalion marched south  And objective basically march Route 1  ran straight middle Hue  assail citadel outside  basically seal enemy troops inside fort  And got less mile two came heavy fire  It turns marching straight toward central command post North Vietnamese Viet Cong and  literally  thousands enemy soldiers  So ended pinned fields  mortared  attacked  And enemy surrounded them  So literally island  And I add air support  The weather bad couldn t get aircraft them  They stranded without kind artillery air support depended on  DAVIES  And units decimated reported commanders  response  BOWDEN  The attitude panicking fire   things couldn t bad claimed were  They wanted continue attacking  And commanders ground could see exactly going knew would suicidal press on  So eventually organized managed   know  long night   walk darkness   daringly walked straight encirclement  Half managed escape  The rest either killed wounded evacuated  DAVIES  So communist forces took control city  And while  American counterattack undermanned commanders didn t realize serious situation was  Eventually  did  And it s fascinating  You write commanders sent enough troops firepower realize fight different kind war take Hue back  BOWDEN  Yeah  And  really  hero struggle Colonel Ernie Cheatham  former NFL football player gone Marine Corps playing Baltimore Colts Pittsburgh Steelers  And given   demanded  really  men sent away  determined get back control  He felt misused  He sent Hue organize things take city back  And spent night went   actually looked old Marine Corps manuals urban fighting  The last time Marines fought big city Seoul Korean War  And read learned proper way assault building fortified position reduce position  basically destroy building heavy weapons bring scene  Use gas force people attack  DAVIES  Tear gas  BOWDEN  Use tear gas force people out  And began methodically   block block   essentially destroying city marched forward taking back one block another  Behind   ruins  acres ruins  So still plenty firefights  And plenty Marines getting killed wounded took city  But worked  It clear first day two strategy tactics going successful  DAVIES  You know  it s one thing use tactics military forces  But city 140 000 people  A lot stayed  BOWDEN  Right  DAVIES   Dug  know  bunkers homes  BOWDEN  Right  DAVIES  What happened kind assault occurred  BOWDEN  A lot got killed  And I estimate that  know  5 000 10 000 civilians killed battle  They   inside citadel  trapped  There literally way get way  And thing could dig bunkers houses try ride things out  Of course  house bunker took direct hit  would kill everybody it  So brutal killing ground  In southern part city  hundreds hundreds civilians basically roaming streets like ants hot plate  know  trying find safe place  And weren t many  DAVIES  Mark Bowden s new book  Hue 1968  A Turning Point In The American War In Vietnam  We ll continue conversation short break  This FRESH AIR   SOUNDBITE OF DAN AUERBACH SONG   HEARTBROKEN  IN DISREPAIR  DAVIES  This FRESH AIR  And we re speaking writer Mark Bowden  He s national correspondent The Atlantic contributing editor Vanity Fair  His new book pivotal battle Vietnam War  Hue 1968  You know  I don t want question anybody s commitment patriotism bravery  But command decisions made   I mean  make want weep  BOWDEN  It reflection arrogance  You know  American military  going Vietnam  powerful military force world  probably  I mean  Soviet Union pretty big army  well  But victors World War II  They victors Korea  There idea America invincible power  And thought peasants Vietnam could organize fight effectively against  know  air cav units would come helicopters guns blaring tremendous air power United States could bring   inconceivable American commanders really serious fight  It became believable Americans ground found facing down  know  superior enemy forces  But even tried convince superior officers they re against  often disbelieved  DAVIES  And Tet Offensive rest country  What course take  BOWDEN  Well  interestingly  know  Hue got relatively little publicity time  even though far largest battle fought Tet Offensive  And big part military command kept denying actually happening  But attacks Saigon  dozens cities   hundred  actually   across country  And attacks reported  shocked American people  And shocked fed line war General Westmoreland  President Johnson  administration  know  going fairly easy affair  Now  suddenly  turn TV pick newspaper  And see entire country South Vietnam attack  And casualty figures  know  jump way up  It ultimately  Dave  turning point Americans war Vietnam  DAVIES  There lot American Western media throughout country  And many got Hue  including Gene Roberts  former editor The Inquirer  I know worked him  BOWDEN  Yeah  DAVIES  Eventually  Walter Cronkite  BOWDEN  Yeah  You know  Walter got fed Tet Offensive supporter War Vietnam  broadcasts evening essentially delivering official line going there  He believed  know  General Westmoreland President Johnson  And   Tet Offensive happened  realized   he s old combat correspondent World War II   story told   fact  story delivering American people appear true  So went fact finding tour Vietnam and  fact  interviewed Westmoreland  assured Hue control  There nothing really serious going there  So went Hue  landed right middle horrific battle  And could see eyes lied to  So came back United States  And delivered famous homily Vietnam winnable war  It stalemate  And best could hope political solution  DAVIES  So end  American counterattacks   South Vietnamese counterattacks   drove communist forces cities  But changed course war  It changed American support war  What kind damage inflict Viet Cong North Vietnamese  BOWDEN  It heavily damaged them  You know  I think that  know  purely military perspective  criticism happened immediately afterwards target  If United States  instance  launched aggressive counterattack invaded North Vietnam  lot people wanted do  know  significantly reduced capabilities North Vietnamese point  And would ve hell fight hands  But might able make progress  In fact  happened was  know  President Johnson announced going run president again  He fed up  I think  dealing whole thing  He tried initiatives end war  He offered bombing halt  And signal  really  lot Americans fighting South Vietnam that  fact  chance United States ever going win war  I point book that  Tet Offensive  longer argument win  It argument leave  DAVIES  And listeners didn t live this  tie story war ended  BOWDEN  Well  war dragged another six seven years  President Nixon got elected 1968 secret plan end War Vietnam  turned spreading war Laos Cambodia  kicked regime Pol Pot genocides Cambodia  Another half   know  probably another half million Vietnamese killed  Tens thousands Americans killed protracted period United States began gradually withdrawing forces Nixon s Vietnamization program  And happened Americans began withdraw  South Vietnamese couldn t stand Viet Cong North Vietnamese  And   it  1974   75  DAVIES  Five  Yeah  BOWDEN  The   Saigon fell  And Americans South Vietnamese lost war  DAVIES  Why focus battle telling story  BOWDEN  Well  know  I think preferred way work writing something sweeping War Vietnam write seven volume history entire war find dramatic pivotal moment story  And can  I think  dig deep enough  use event kind lens write whole experience War Vietnam  What investigating taught that  fact  I think right oppose war  It mistake  It reflected triumph ideology reality Washington  anti communist ideology completely ignored realities Southeast Asia Vietnam s history actually happening there  And I think kind periodic thing happens American life  where  know  concepts world America s role world lead us conflicts   collide reality  This happened recently American history  So  know  DAVIES  Let s talk little  I mean  know  I think phenomenon where  State Department parts American government  veterans know local custom culture politics economy  And big things happen  often shunted aside  decisions made top  Do see mistakes repeated Iraq  Afghanistan  BOWDEN  Absolutely  In case Vietnam  I think David Halberstam recorded definitively book  The Best And The Brightest    how  period decade more  Southeast Asian experts   people  say  spoke language lived knew history culture   purged State Department administration Washington  By time Johnson president  dared speak American effort Vietnam  you d gone soft  You soft communism  know  heels  Yeah  I think thing happened 9 11  You know  idea United States terminal battle radical Islam across planet required us to  know  invade Afghanistan invade Iraq  And I think  point  people advising caution restraint regarded unpatriotic   listened to  I think we re danger happening today  We Trump administration  I think  know  inflexible  ideological view world also anti intellectual administration  So people knowledge  people experience speak language viewed tainted precisely happen know they re talking about  And I think things happen  often country make dreadful mistakes  DAVIES  Well  it s remarkable book  Mark

Story, Times  Reporters Describe How A Paper Trail Helped Break The Weinstein Story Enlarge image toggle caption Anne Christine Poujoulat AFP Getty Images Anne Christine Poujoulat AFP Getty Images On Oct  5  The New York Times published article detailing alleged sexual misconduct film executive Harvey Weinstein dated back nearly three decades  The article featured evidence interviews describing pattern film producer would invite young women business meeting  sometimes hotel room  sexually assault harass them  The Times investigative reporters broke story  Jodi Kantor Megan Twohey  say worked hard persuade Weinstein s accusers speak them  Twohey says Kantor continuously assured sources   We re going work story hard around clock get it  get truth   we re going publish truth  Since initial article published  Kantor Twohey reported new allegations Weinstein well famous men  Earlier month  Kantor contributed piece detailing alleged sexual misconduct comedian Louis C K  Kantor says sees larger story sexual misconduct powerful men  reckoning excavation   Part Megan I grappling every single day happen    We re trying justify anything  trying explain it  Interview Highlights On documents helped break open story Jodi Kantor  Really important components reporting were  first all  figuring settlement trail  We able trace legal financial records Harvey Weinstein     silenced women come forward sort allegation  using money  using legal muscle  using sort professional intimidation  And goal almost reverse engineer process  Here women silenced means  But also thought means evidence something happened  right  And even we re sort persuading actors ex employees talk us record  also building timeline happened  And thing looking documents evidence  One powerful things first story 2015 memo young employee named Lauren O Connor wrote  working Weinstein Co  That s memo line   The balance power  is me  0  Harvey Weinstein  10  And it s long memo details sexual harassment company  able get able get company records  So really helped actually getting women record  saying them   This story like going alone Harvey Weinstein word happened hotel room  On nondisclosure agreements used silence Weinstein s accusers Megan Twohey  This wasn t single predator came view course reporting  broad system women step forward allegations sexual harassment sexual assault people workplace industries often silenced settlements receive financial compensation experience   The compensation  comes price  They required never speak allegation ever again  And that s sort baseline level silencing  Sometimes settlements much elaborate require   If somebody comes   press ever comes comment   say positive things me  On coordination involved setting Weinstein s hotel room meetings Kantor  What s remarkable degree facilitation required    The construct women coming meetings Miramax Weinstein Co  studio head    When I interviewed Gwyneth Paltrow  said   The reason I went meeting I fax  Creative Artists Agency  telling meet Harvey Weinstein  It really supposed work appointment  And often assistants showed women room    Think everything required put whole system place  travel arrangements  logistics  schedules  assistants  money pay lavish hotel suites  kind work schedules involved  So part emerged summer portrait methodology really chilling  On counterattack launched Italian model Ambra Battilana filed police complaint Weinstein 2015 Twohey  There Italian model showed Weinstein Co  business meeting Harvey Weinstein  And within hours leaving  went police department New York said groped willing make police complaint it  And it s interesting see situation whole team swooped help Harvey fight counterattack effort  There private investigators dispatched basically dig dirt her  There stories planted tabloids basically disparage background  There high profile attorneys stepped Harvey s side  including Linda Fairstein  former sex crimes prosecutor Manhattan  willing facilitate introductions current sex crimes prosecutor handling case  And within weeks case dead  On took long allegations Weinstein become public Twohey  There reporters tried story many years  going back many years  see stories killed die published  And people reached spoken previous journalists previous attempts story  was  I think  level cynicism Harvey Weinstein kills stories  knows stop tracks  He s either going come The New York Times bully story  threaten sue you  somehow kind buy guys sort fashion    And something Jodi I continuously throughout reporting process  assure

Reckoning,In mid nineteen eighties  aspiring stockbroker named Lori Hurwitz got job Garden City  Long Island  office Shearson Lehman Brothers  one largest brokerage firms Wall Street  Hurwitz twenty three  spent days apprentice pair experienced male brokers  less desirable work  cold calling several hundred strangers day trying pitch opening accounts firm  The brokerage business exciting  growing profession a career future  The problem  Hurwitz s perspective  environment utterly hostile women  The branch manager open fact paid women office significantly less men  and  detailed Susan Antilla s   Tales Boom Boom Room  The Landmark Legal Battles That Exposed Wall Street s Shocking Culture Sexual Harassment   definitive book era  oppressive atmosphere sexual banter crude jokes  In office s basement infamous  Boom Boom Room  itself  liquor soaked happy hour parties hosted  When Hurwitz finally complained manager sex jokes lack opportunity  things got even worse  Eventually  told that  couldn t get along guys  seek another career  After fourteen months job  Hurwitz quit  In week s issue The New Yorker   I wrote article gender imbalance sexual harassment Silicon Valley   The tech industry  like entertainment media industries  recently forced acknowledge pervasive problem issues  As women industries and others have come forward accounts discrimination  harassment  even sexual assault context workplaces  comparisons Wall Street become increasingly relevant  The financial industry nineteen eighties nineties many great fortunes last generation made and also setting dramatic gender discrimination lawsuits corporate America ever seen  A handful banks ended paying millions dollars fines legal settlements cases whose salacious details made international headlines  For wondering current wave accusations resignations might translate lasting change improvements professional women  Wall Street s history instructive  In nineteen nineties  many women started seeking careers banks brokerage firms  looking take places professionals breadwinners alongside men  encountered barriers ranging harassment assault pay discrimination unequal access opportunities  Women harder time gaining entry prestigious training programs  given less time study mandatory tests male colleagues were  According  Tales Boom Boom Room  female  control administrators  Smith Barney median pay  50 405  males made  67 614  In 1996  three women  Pamela Martens  Judith Mione  Roberta O Brien Thomann  filed class action lawsuit Smith Barney  which merged Shearson  charging company gender discrimination  Smith Barney eventually paid hundred fifty million dollars arbitration awards settlements resolve case  On surface  appeared financial industry learned lessons lawsuit others like it  Large banks brokerage firms implemented harassment training compliance measures  hired experienced professionals run human resources departments  But  I recently asked Susan Antilla  reporting fellow Investigative Fund Nation Institute  believed Wall Street truly reformed itself  said   Pretty much  no  Antilla said similarities what s happening today older Wall Street cases  Then  now  said  stories seemed come waves  She recalled sexual harassment case wrote 1995  small brokerage called Olde Discount Corp  prompted Pam Martens  one lead Smith Barney plaintiffs  hire lawyers case  A year Martens s case garnered public attention  group women banded together sued Merrill Lynch   It dominoes  Antilla told me  However  said  financial industry  long run  become much welcoming women before   Something I ve found stories years gets headlines  revert back norm  Antilla said  She added powerful response allegations Harvey Weinstein   international attention attracted  gave hope maybe time would different  But Wall Street precedent isn t encouraging  When comes equal pay  example  Antilla pointed recent study Institute Women s Policy Research gender pay gap across different industries  listed financial occupations among worst  job personal financial adviser  example  shown largest gap  women earning 55 6 per cent men did  And  Antilla said   terrible pay harassment go hand hand   O K  they ve taken Playboy centerfold cubicle  Antilla said   There things don t anymore  You would never see  big brokerage firm  saw Smith Barney  would send stripper someone s birthday  But it s women aren t harassed  She also noted financial firms pioneers using arbitration  rather courts  settle workplace cases  Private arbitration generally viewed favorable employers  added bonus keeping disputes eye press   I think arbitration reason Wall Street moved on  sometimes even goes backwards  they ve institutionalized ability keep problem public view  Antilla said   When years years that  people start feel entitled whatever want  act impunity  Other industries such Silicon Valley have followed Wall Street s example  increasingly insisting arbitration agreements employees  Still  Antilla told heartened bravery seen lately among women coming forward lodge harassment charges high profile men  public outrage directed toward alleged harassers  One biggest differences she s noticed nineteen nineties lawsuits cases filed today  Antilla said  technology providing tools make easier women collect evidence  turn makes harder companies ignore complaints might past  Several cases including Gretchen Carlson  filed sexual harassment charges former Fox News chief Roger Ailes  case reportedly settled twenty million dollars have involved women made audio recordings alleged harassers   For years  impossible  said  said  Antilla said   When I talk employment lawyers now  tell people regularly come offices they ve got something phones   She added people looking record alleged harassment  anything else  need insure legal state make recordings without permission  When I asked Antilla anything else felt women facing workplace discrimination

Chemistry  published earlier year  unnamed female chemistry Ph D  student navigating American academia modern romance  She also daughter ambitious Chinese parents immigrated United States Cultural Revolution  The novel repeatedly upends expectations  it s bildungsroman heroine doesn t much go world conquer go world gradually turn inward  The book s striking attribute narrator s voice  clipped  understated  curiously affectless  Here  instance  describes difference life s trajectory white Midwestern boyfriend  Eric  also chemistry grad student  I certain Eric get job  His career path straight  like arrow target  If I draw path out  would look like gas particle flying around space  The lab mate often echoes wisdom many chemists her  You must love chemistry even working  You must love chemistry unconditionally  Voice  ephemeral yet indelible quality  poses challenge critics  embedded language seems hover beyond it  And similarly amorphous literary effects tone  mood  atmosphere voice seems intimately connected human speaker behind text  Indeed  I read   Chemistry   I found identifying Wang s protagonist we re female Chinese immigrant grad students America but also Wang herself  who  like me  born China 1989  Wang s first person voice  words  returned own  I also reminded  voice  books near experience might classified works Asian Anglophone fiction  I thought  instance  dispassionate first person narrators Kazuo Ishiguro s novels  Chang rae Lee s similarly evasive  entirely affectless  speaker novel  A Gesture Life  Ed Park s office novel  Personal Days  features distinctively impersonal first person plural voice  I thought Tao Lin s Internet age autofiction  The backgrounds writers vary widely  Ishiguro son Japanese immigrants England  Lin son Taiwanese immigrants United States  Lee Park Korean American  But them  work  employed voices seem unusually detached voices often later reattached  critics readers  authors themselves   There are  course  many Asian Anglophone writers don t downplay affect fiction  Gish Jen Alexander Chee Jenny Zhang on it s long list  Lee written lyrical narrators  Henry Park  Native Speaker   Asian American  pan ethnic identity category newish construction  one unites people  sometimes awkwardly  dramatically disparate cultures  As Jay Caspian Kang wrote recently Times Magazine     Discrimination really binds Asian Americans together   In West  Asiatic figure long associated aloofness obfuscation  exemplified notion  inscrutable Oriental  The image rife fiction poetry  found writing Ezra Pound  T  S  Eliot  Jack Kerouac  Gary Snyder  The phenomenon persists contemporary literary fiction  affective alienness David Mitchell s dystopian Korean community  Cloud Atlas  Adam Johnson s navigation North Korea  The Orphan Master s Son  character Jun Do   The pun intended  Against tradition  is  perhaps  another emerging  Asian Anglophone writers play thus begin undo tropes Asian impersonality  The novels Ishiguro  Park  Lin  Wang feature first person narrators keep distance actively denying readers direct interior access  This true  it s important note  even characters write Asian  From Ishiguro s famously oblique British butler narrator  The Remains Day whose voice since become hallmark Ishiguro s style to Lin s impassive young people  protagonists  created vastly different writers  work standard ideas rich novelistic subjectivity  These writers seem engaging enduring stereotypes order overturn them  Sunny Xiang  assistant professor English Yale  writing book post Cold War Asian American novels represent literary voices  Asian  Xiang interested racialized stereotype inscrutable Oriental also Orientalist scrutability  that is  literary factors make narrative voice scan  readers  Asian  I told Xiang reaction Wang s book  She said reader confronted unplaceable  inscrutable  voice   an intuitive response seems interpretive gesture you re describing that reattaching voice way author reader  For you  shared biographical profile provided reliable footing  even weren t relying footing purpose interpretation  I decided ask Wang saw things way I did  But  I suggested reading  Chemistry  terms trope Asian affectlessness  demurred  Over phone  explained didn t see heroine primarily Chinese or  matter  primarily female but  first foremost  analytical   I wanted narrator self aware  said   to scientific lens that s little bit objective also crazy  Of course  one might trace attribute part China s postwar prioritization scientific pursuits path toward upward mobility economic expansion another Asian American stereotype science nerd  All characters  Chemistry  left nameless except Eric  narrator s boyfriend   Even gets first name  I suggested Wang something impersonal absence names  saw it  told me  matter scientific categories  there s dog  lab partner  shrink  immigrant parents  best friend  cheating husband  nanny  Chemistry generalizing process  Wang explained   build small rule applies everything  In  Chemistry  character depth established  unexpectedly  kind under telling  The narrator s Chinese immigrant parents who are  perhaps incidentally  novel s obviously racialized characters achieve interiority precisely appear first dogmatically eschew it  In college  narrator learns that  father young  carried dying sister back see doctor  sister died way there  She hadn t even known sister  It  the Chinese way  explains   to keep deepest feelings inside build wall seen moon  As novel progresses   the narrator realizes parents thoughts separate hers  Wang put me  The parents kept stories daughter  evasive narrative voice echoes come understand own  By end  idea yet said  Although Wang think narrator primarily Chinese  it s impossible read narrator s story without sensing history behind it  The narrator  Chemistry  worries always lag behind white boyfriend   Please stop  little while  let catch up  thinks   How expect marry never let catch up  When spoke  Wang connected China s economic cultural  behindness  Cultural Revolution which precipitated political upheaval also economic cultural stagnation to protagonist s anxieties   You void you re trying fill time  said   And that s latches onto Eric  full person  For her  there s something missing  Ed Park offered different perspective  In   Personal Days   Park  like Wang  avoids proper names  Writing first person plural  employs  we  narrator dissolves private individuality personhood referencing anonymous tone corporate bureaucracy  That foreclosed possibility explicitly Asian protagonist  Park told  didn t want voice function clue  identity characters  When I asked idea I d forming Asian Anglophone fiction  told that  him  least  Ishiguro s influence indeed essential     The Remains Day  important book twenty five years ago I fascinated idea author Asian ancestry writing outside skin  said   I hadn t read anything like before  seemed open many possibilities  After first encounter  Park read Ishiguro s first two novels   A Pale View Hills  told perspective woman trapped Gothic domestic plot postwar Japan   An Artist Floating World  Japanese painter ends making Fascist propaganda art Second World War  Both novels use voice startlingly even toned horrors stories suggest  They anticipate distinctly English narrators almost Ishiguro s subsequent novels  Critics frequently asked Ishiguro whether anything fundamentally Japanese staid characters even  perhaps especially  English butler  He usually directed questioners Britain s tradition repression circumlocution  He also often described intent write universal matters and offers another way thinking narrators  uncanny tone  This sentiment echoed novelists Ha Jin Haruki Murakami  expressed concern prose translate  Paradoxically  Asian writers  attempt universal make one vulnerable essentializing  When spoke  Wang described something similar  In reading Asian American literature  said  found  that race issue always prominent that there s Asian American protagonist think certain way  She wanted come things  from different angle       explain experience something little universal  That  said  didn t name narrator  school attends   I wanted create sense world without pinpointing specificity it  For part  Park told reading Ishiguro s books left wondering much Ishiguro s ultimate success coincided eventual choice write Asian subjects and Park hinted next novel explicitly address questions Korean ethnicity  Xiang  meanwhile  considers Ishiguro outlier   I d wager extremely hard writers already marked  Asian Anglophone  disaffiliate category  told me  In October  Ishiguro s outlier status seemed confirmed named recipient 2017 Nobel Prize Literature

Roy Moore  Alabama Republican nominee U S  Senate  engaged predatory behavior teen age girls thirties  poses test Republicans  would farcical say first difficult problem posed them  Roy Moore tests administered regularly  exceptions G O P s leaders failed spectacularly  On October 26th  example  Senator Jeff Flake  Arizona  said could endorse Moore  a guy says Muslim member Congress shouldn t able serve that s right  This is  indeed  something Moore said  2006  opinion piece WorldNetDaily  argued Representative Keith Ellison  Democrat Minnesota  seated  questioned October  said article accurate expression views  But  two days Flake s remarks  Republican National Committee National Republican Senatorial Committee entered joint fund raising agreement Moore  one number ways institutional Party put weight behind campaign   On Friday afternoon  N S R C  withdrew  Neither Flake s warning speech gave Senate floor pointing Moore  talks good deal religious freedom  trampling tradition caused anyone Republican leadership budge  This true even though  Alabama primary  Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell  endorsed Moore s opponent Luther Strange  But Moore s victory seemed wash away  The Majority Whip  Senator John Cornyn  Texas  endorsed him  Rand Paul Ted Cruz  Others dodged questions him  One Republican senators join Flake who is  perhaps incidentally  retiring term in openly refusing endorse Moore Ben Sasse  Nebraska  said   The Constitution pretty dang clear religious litmus test  What litmus tests Republican Party days  Islamophobia evidently wasn t enough end support Moore  neither  apparently  imprecations homosexuality criminally punished Supreme Court s marriage equality ruling worse Dred Scott decision  record twice removed Alabama bench defying  ordering judges defy  federal courts  regarding Ten Commandments monument outside courthouse  attempt deny marriage equality Alabama couples  foundation formed hosted  Secession Day  events  brandishing gun stage political rally  comments Bible superseding American law  belief birtherism though one  actually  loops back Islamophobia  President Trump  The President  first backed Strange  later said Moore  sounds like really great guy  If really weren t enough  Republican Party alleged abuse teen age girls consider  According Post   1979  Moore  thirty two  targeted one girl  Leigh Corfman  fourteen years old sitting outside courtroom parents  process divorcing  custody hearing  Her mother sitting Moore  assistant district attorney  office hall  first approached  offered watch Leigh mother went judge  presenting himself  officer court  respectable momentary guardian   He said   Oh  don t want go hear that  I ll stay her    Corfman s mother told Post   Leigh was  words  explicitly child obviously vulnerable  And that  Leigh said  Moore asked phone number  later  twice went home  picked car  drove house woods  The first time  kissed her  second time  took clothes his  touched sexually touch before  request  took home  She told Post remembered thinking   Please get with  Whatever is  get over  Moore said Corfman s charges  charges three women  sixteen  seventeen  eighteen time reported incidents  politically motivated lies he called  garbage  On Friday  radio interview Sean Hannity  said  Corfman s account   it never happened  didn t know was  He said vaguely remembered meeting two women  families  behavior always  appropriate indeed  said   a special concern safety young ladies  never dated woman without mother s permission  And told Hannity timing story  four weeks election  suspicious it s obvious casual observer something s up and that  indeed  launched investigation already turned evidence  collusion  would release good time  His opponents  said  resented faith God  After Post story  many Republican leaders Alabama  Charles Bethea noted   hurried say didn t believe allegations or  worse  didn t matter true either even molesting Republican better Democrat  weren t really sure bad man thirties sexually propositioning teen agers   One  Jim Zeigler  Alabama state auditor  compared relationship St  Joseph Mary  Washington Republicans circumspect  answers  too  qualified  They called Moore step aside if  McConnell put it   these allegations true  Flake went bit further  saying Moore leave race immediately even  shred truth  story  John McCain  Arizona  exception  saying heard enough disqualify Moore office   He immediately step aside allow people Alabama elect candidate proud of  McCain said  The pride G O P  might added  stake  too  The statement White House Moore story began caveat  Like Americans  President believes cannot allow mere allegation in case  one many years ago to destroy person s life  One might read reference charges attached Trump himself  And statement note  the President also believes allegations true  Judge Moore right thing step aside  If doesn t  President push him  shrug  On Fox News Thursday night  Hannity  often acts id Trumpist wing Party  said   How possibly tell  know  truth   Hannity also agreed guest said relations  consensual  though later said applied seventeen  eighteen year olds  A better question G O P  prove party Roy Moore not comes exploiting young denying members L G B T Q  community people minority religions full citizenship  It late Moore removed Alabama ballot  That doesn t mean and G O P  cannot allowed pretend means that Party doesn t choices  If state Party disqualified nomination  even Moore got votes wouldn t get seat  Perhaps practically  G O P  could endorse spend money supporting write in candidate  As Senator Lisa Murkowski  Republican Alaska  reminded colleagues  feasible option she write in  By trying options  G O P  actively decided would

couldn t get along guys  seek another career  After fourteen months job  Hurwitz quit  In week s issue The New Yorker   I wrote article gender imbalance sexual harassment Silicon Valley   The tech industry  like entertainment media industries  recently forced acknowledge pervasive problem issues  As women industries and others have come forward accounts discrimination  harassment  even sexual assault context workplaces  comparisons Wall Street become increasingly relevant  The financial industry nineteen eighties nineties many great fortunes last generation made and also setting dramatic gender discrimination lawsuits corporate America ever seen  A handful banks ended paying millions dollars fines legal settlements cases whose salacious details made international headlines  For wondering current wave accusations resignations might translate lasting change improvements professional women  Wall Street s history instructive  In nineteen nineties  many women started seeking careers banks brokerage firms  looking take places professionals breadwinners alongside men  encountered barriers ranging harassment assault pay discrimination unequal access opportunities  Women harder time gaining entry prestigious training programs  given less time study mandatory tests male colleagues were  According  Tales Boom Boom Room  female  control administrators  Smith Barney median pay  50 405  males made  67 614  In 1996  three women  Pamela Martens  Judith Mione  Roberta O Brien Thomann  filed class action lawsuit Smith Barney  which merged Shearson  charging company gender discrimination  Smith Barney eventually paid hundred fifty million dollars arbitration awards settlements resolve case  On surface  appeared financial industry learned lessons lawsuit others like it  Large banks brokerage firms implemented harassment training compliance measures  hired experienced professionals run human resources departments  But  I recently asked Susan Antilla  reporting fellow Investigative Fund Nation Institute  believed Wall Street truly reformed itself  said   Pretty much  no  Antilla said similarities what s happening today older Wall Street cases  Then  now  said  stories seemed come waves  She recalled sexual harassment case wrote 1995  small brokerage called Olde Discount Corp  prompted Pam Martens  one lead Smith Barney plaintiffs  hire lawyers case  A year Martens s case garnered public attention  group women banded together sued Merrill Lynch   It dominoes  Antilla told me  However  said  financial industry  long run  become much welcoming women before   Something I ve found stories years gets headlines  revert back norm  Antilla said  She added powerful response allegations Harvey Weinstein   international attention attracted  gave hope maybe time would different  But Wall Street precedent isn t encouraging  When comes equal pay  example  Antilla pointed recent study Institute Women s Policy Research gender pay gap across different industries  listed financial occupations among worst  job personal financial adviser  example  shown largest gap  women earning 55 6 per cent men did  And  Antilla said   terrible pay harassment go hand hand   O K  they ve taken Playboy centerfold cubicle  Antilla said   There things don t anymore  You would never see  big brokerage firm  saw Smith Barney  would send stripper someone s birthday  But it s women aren t harassed  She also noted financial firms pioneers using arbitration  rather courts  settle workplace cases  Private arbitration generally viewed favorable employers  added bonus keeping disputes eye press   I think arbitration reason Wall Street moved on  sometimes even goes backwards  they ve institutionalized ability keep problem public view  Antilla said   When years years that  people start feel entitled whatever want  act impunity  Other industries such Silicon Valley have followed Wall Street s example  increasingly insisting arbitration agreements employees  Still  Antilla told heartened bravery seen lately among women coming forward lodge harassment charges high profile men  public outrage directed toward alleged harassers  One biggest differences she s noticed nineteen nineties lawsuits cases filed today  Antilla said  technology providing tools make easier women collect evidence  turn makes harder companies ignore complaints might past  Several cases including Gretchen Carlson  filed sexual harassment charges former Fox News chief Roger Ailes  case reportedly settled twenty million dollars have involved women

Investigation,What Republicans want Attorney General Jeff Sessions  And Hillary Clinton Roy Moore  Yesterday  Sessions testified  four hours  House Judiciary Committee  Democrat Democrat asked variation question whether he d perjured confirmation hearings  last January  That Senator Al Franken  Democrat Minnesota  asked Trump campaign s contacts Russians  Sessions said he  campaign surrogate  meet Russians know ties  It since emerged Sessions met Russian Ambassador United States campaign meeting Russian contacts mentioned  For various reasons  mostly tricks memory  specific wording Franken used  and  Sessions said yesterday  shocked question s premise  maintained neither lying hearings lying now  For obvious reasons  Democrats weren t satisfied  Their Republican colleagues tried defend Attorney General  effort  too  strained and  times  came cost Sessions   It seems like  me  got mistreated little bit  Representative Louie Gohmert  Texas  began  Gohmert  has  past  pushed baseless theories ranging birtherism incipient federal jihadi invasion Texas  said didn t think Sessions lied didn t need media outlet like Mother Jones  which one Democrats cited  tell otherwise  Then asked Sessions whether  deciding earlier year recuse himself presumably  reference Sessions s recusal investigation Russian interference 2016 election  though one never knows Gohmert he consulted deputy  Rod Rosenstein  Sessions seemed unsure much say internal deliberations  also Gohmert heading  Gohmert interrupted read string e mail addresses  least one ending  ru  brandished

So aware Rosenstein prior dealing Russian uranium recused yourself  you  As Sessions tried get Gohmert clarify  congressman continued   You aware Mueller Comey investigation Russian uranium  you  recused yourself   Nuh ah  Sessions began  nervous laugh   I don t think so  Then brightened  said definitely   No  I not  course  I wasn t Department Justice  Gohmert told chart explaining all the camera turned tortured piece political art  linking boxes various shapes colors contained names phrases like Rosatom  another Russian energy firm  Huma Abedin   Hillary Clinton Secret Server   Fast   Furious   executive privilege  along Rod Rosenstein  Robert Mueller  James Comey  Gohmert s point seemed Sessions somehow tricked recusal   It sure stinks high heaven  doesn t appear ought involved investigating  Gohmert said  as  last  time expired  Sessions  next questioner began  took moment try sort out  least defend Rosenstein  The transaction heart roughly referred Clinton uranium story acquisition  2010  company called Uranium One  owned uranium resources United States  subsidiary Rosatom called ARMZ  a name that  remarkably  Gohmert chart   During campaign  I wrote issues involved   The Maryland case taken place couple years later   and it s really unrelated allegations Uranium One  I understand it  Sessions said  This doesn t mean Sessions s Justice Department isn t interested Clinton uranium  On Monday  department sent letter certain members House Judiciary Committee  response inquiries  saying that  wouldn t want confirm existence investigation  begun  evaluate certain issues  representatives raised   including sale Uranium One  alleged unlawful dealings related Clinton Foundation  matters  The department would also see whether matters  merit appointment Special Counsel  In words  Administration Donald Trump might trying make good campaign promise  regard Hillary Clinton   lock up  Whether motive retribution distraction Trump s Russia troubles  would blatantly political use executive branch s investigative powers  Trump isn t particularly shy that  indeed has  President  asked Twitter Sessions isn t  looking crooked Hillary crimes Russia relations  Representative John Conyers  Democrat Michigan  quoted tweet questioned Sessions  also asked Sessions s recusal  though way made much sense Gohmert s questions had  Conyers wanted know Sessions s reason withdrawing Russian interference investigation namely  part Trump campaign didn t apply much inquiry Trump s campaign opponent   I cannot answer yes no  because  policies Department Justice  announce recusal investigation would reveal existence investigation  Sessions replied   And top ethics officials advised I so  But even politicized Justice Department investigation might lead special counsel enough Republicans committee  They wanted special counsel just like Mueller  only  luck  indicting Clinton campaign officials right now   What s going take get special counsel  Ohio Republican

terms violated rule No  1 U S  government learned years interacting North Koreans   Whatever do  don t personally insult man  DiMaggio put it  In fact  name calling repeats American tactic backfired previous North Korean leaders   The idea administration has and particularly President Trump that escalating threats going make North Koreans flexible  wrong  Escalating threats make North Koreans inflexible  Wit said   Being gratuitously tough    added later   is big mistake  North Koreans tough nails themselves  them  weak like committing suicide  But Trump gone tough talk anyway  Will matter

  It s they re put together inflated rhetoric  That s I start getting worried increased potential misunderstanding and actual conflict    It didn t turn way  according DiMaggio Wit  In fact  North

relationship Obama administration turned sour  especially U S  sanctioned Kim Jong Un personally  That really blew relationship water  Wit agreed that  got little attention time  Obama administration misread Kim succeeded father 2010  failed pursue new nuclear talks might kept North Koreans away achieving nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile reach continental U S  breakthrough brink

administration many worry Trump team  weakened Tillerson depleted  demoralized diplomatic corps  there two current U S  officials  Wit said  even met North Koreans  might able undertake meaningful nuclear talks anyway  But DiMaggio insisted interview genuine approach   Based conversations immediately inauguration  I traveled Pyongyang meet them  clear could new beginning  said   They certainly

 I look ratings regular basis clearly Fox outrageously well  said Charles Herring  president Fox rival One America Network s parent company  Herring Networks   I believe anybody who s trying compete

combinations get 270  50  10  one  9 49 And Clinton campaign staff spent election night   The senior staff gathered Peninsula Hotel  working there  And around  I m sure exactly time   I think probably around 7 30  Florida started look great  North Carolina didn t look good  I didn t expect going win North Carolina anyway  And then  Virginia started sliding  weren t sure problem South problem everywhere  But eventually by  say  probably 9 00 so  became clear problems states  Most states 2 3 percentage points expected be  And big lead like Colorado Virginia  OK  didn t big lead states  starting spell real trouble  11 45 Frazier details Cruz staff spent election night   So night  couple election parties went to  I think dropped POLITICO party  ended party  I cannot remember whose was  watching map and  sudden  tables turning  You saw states one expected Trump carry  And late night  realizing  know   Holy wow  could actually win this  And end up  We ended at  like  Shake Shack midnight 1 00 a m  grabbing burgers  It incredible thing watch  I mean  historic moment  I think almost everyone caught surprise  even Trump campaign  13 30 Bondi shares memory first phone call Trump election   My friend s daughter changed several ringtones week before  And changed best friends   ringtones  favorite songs  changed president s  Hail Chief  But hadn t called since changed phone  So  I m back hotel room  well   well 2 00 am  phone rings  I hearing  Hail Chief  I m like  that  And so  I answered it  then elect  current elect President Trump  He driving home wife  called say  know   Pamela  it  And Florida  And   happy  very  humbled  And said nice things Secretary Clinton time conversation had  called him  And pretty surreal   moment surreal  14 50 Frazier shares details first post election interaction Ted Cruz   The senator optimistic attitude  And genuinely excited seeing Republicans taken White House  Senate House   majorities across board  And basically sat team was  like   Look  time  We going able part implementing things we ve talked long  rolling back regulations  tax reform  repealing Obamacare  really set stage phenomenal year Senate  I think whole team   able really see things we ve talking long come fruition  16 51 Palmieri says questioned election results instantly sought action   I suspicious immediately  Like  turning way thought would  know Russians trying influence election Podesta s emails WikiLeaks  also  point  already public knowledge attempted point year get different state s databanks voting  So  was  like  immediately  I like   This expected  fight on  So election night  I m still thinking recount opportunities  Electoral College  absorbed  that  election night bad night surprise  necessarily end  It made sense given hard rest campaign made sense that  know  like  think would outright easily election night  Like  would one night would turn predicted  But I wasn t necessarily willing think end   It hard wrap head around fact weren t   know  you d sort nod say   OK  Well  tomorrow  we ll figure we re going do  remember tomorrow  18 58 Sanders says certain things Trump campaign went unnoticed election   What I know today I didn t know Nov  8 Trump campaign highly organized campaign apparatus  organized I think us actually thought  19 17 And shares wishes Sanders campaign done differently   We barely put money March 1 states Super Tuesday states  Had done that  would competitive delegate count  But lost severely delegate count Super Tuesday  weren t able make  for  deficit  So  would done that  We didn t know going raise much money  When I first came campaign  I started Aug  7 2015  conversation was   Look  raise  50 million February  we ll good  We raised  50 million by  like  September  August  September  So  I don t think even understood scale campaign could grown  So  lots different things  I definitely think underestimated Donald Trump  We would taken seriously  20 10 Frazier weighs Trump s campaign strategy   One thing I say Trump campaign  I think blew everyone water ability drive news cycle  He early  He tweeting  He calling morning shows  And setting stage everyone going talk day  And that s something could probably done lot better  terms news narrative driving communications messaging  20 54 And shares Cruz campaign could learned tactics   I think would got earlier day  probably done shows morning  interviews morning  I mean  runner up 17 primary candidates  So  lot proud of  But I think one aspect driving news cycle something could done better  21 14 Ennis reflects areas Rubio campaign could improved strategy   There several instances primary something would happen narrative coming event really shaped reality  hard kind get around message wanted get kind presented  So  learning creating narrative someone else defines big takeaway me  21 52 Bondi explains believes election polling fell short   I feel like polls missing true number people around country supporting him  The part wasn t truly reported  South Florida  auditorium filled  I remember leaving seeing people lined literally miles miles  It probably 90s day  It hot outside  weren t single file  4  5  6  10 people deep  streets  lined up  waiting see presidential candidate  I d never seen lifetime  22 48 Palmieri says surprised difficulty electing woman president   I think I went campaign  I didn t appreciate hard elect   radical idea look course human history woman charge  And already elected first black president  I didn t think electing first women president going   I thought would hard  And different  it s easy  And I think set prove Hillary qualities people look president  did  it s qualities looked male president that s model had  23 39 And muses might different next woman candidate   I m sure  sit now  anything done real time  I think maybe first woman needed go process  As first women generation  women across board different professions moment  You job  run office  expect way man does  And now  we ve done that  Depending keep score  she s proven woman win election president  And I hope next woman  broader sense women leadership it s model man  I think hard suit  will  woman wear  25 09 Sanders tells perspective brings woman impacted policy discussions   When I first met Sen  Sanders I still interviewing  will  I came office  It I  We sat robust conversation everything  juvenile justice  education  economy  message lots people would say   Sir  I said   Look  Sir  There s lot people would say message doesn t take account systemic racism folks deal every single day life  For people  doesn t matter much money make  went school  kind job have  When walk house everyday  they re quote unquote  black  they re Latino  they re Asian American  Asian American Pacific islander  they re Native American  So talked economy addressing racism parallel actually intertwined issues addressed simultaneously together  We can t talk closing wealth gap without talking racism black brown families locked wealth really long time  And so  kind colored lot things  engaged campaign trail issues  spiraled creating racial justice platform  addressed five different types violence people color America experience every single day  Catherine Frazier  communications director Ted Cruz  said campaigns fell short driving news cycle    Reena Flores POLITICO 26 22 Sanders says several times barred campaign events staff says didn t believe black woman would hold position like hers   There multiple times I would go campaign trail I first started I could get building   Earlier campaign I introduced him  Sen  Sanders  lot rallies things went to  And I remember getting out  I going door  folks like   This staff only  And I m like   OK  I m staff  And like   What kind staff you  I said   Well  I national press secretary  You might seen television  I m going need get there  And they re like   No  need go around front   This happened like two months straight would go places  And it s places South  it s places America  And I late folks calling me  They like   The senator like   Where you  We want start rally  I like   Well  I m outside  And someone would like rally start  need get damn building  So  something I think anybody thought about  That s experience I don t know else that   But I know younger people color worked campaign staff lower levels junior

easy question United States yet answer correctly  And it s reason I worried future country  Story Continued Below That last statement feel cliche given current environment  partisans spin routine conflicts existential threats describe every election final verdict nation s fate  But something different happening politics today  There seems subtle concerted effort paint black citizens criticize President Donald Trump United States un American  Black people dare suggest country living professed ideals offhandedly deemed unpatriotic ungrateful blessing born  shining city upon hill  If critiques met crude suggestion buy one way ticket  back  Africa  we re accused rent seeking laziness victimization  It s though political strategist discovered best way counter claims leaders indifferent pervasive racial inequalities imply accusers hate nation troops  After all  American parade horribles  unpatriotic ingrates worse racist could ever because  well  least racists love America  Why think want badly themselves  There lack incidents create cause concern  When black NFL players kneeled national anthem protest racial injustice  president called  sons bitches  disrespecting nation  flag veterans  He invited professional hockey champion Pittsburgh Penguins White House called all white assembly mostly non American players  incredible patriots  As black man Northern Virginia  I well aware state s gubernatorial race seen bellwether white identity politics electoral expediency racial animus  For weeks  bombarded Republican nominee Ed Gillespie s campaign ads dog whistled soundtracks preservation Confederate statues taking stands Election Day tower lot heathens who d dare take knee national anthem  So view Democrat Ralph Northam s win repudiation politics racial resentment  I remain worried questioning black people s allegiance country still seen viable political strategy  When Rep  Frederica Wilson  black congresswoman Florida  chastised president making insensitive comments Myeshia Johnson  widow U S  Army Sgt  La David Johnson killed Niger  White House chief staff John Kelly called  empty barrel  others labeled national disgrace  The White House contrasted Kelly Wilson  saying  highly inappropriate  question four star general  thank God patriots like Gen  Kelly  The list goes on  Black Lives Matter characterized  un American  Trump emissary former New York Mayor Rudy Guiliani  During Attorney General Jeff Sessions  confirmation hearing  witnesses testified he d called NAACP un American  Trump likened majority black inner cities violent foreign countries  Former Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka recently made dysphemistic suggestion major issue facing black America systemic racism  segregated communities socioeconomic disparities   black African gun crime black Africans  conveniently leaving  American  And  course  things compare Trump s insistence nation s first black president was  fact  American all  And quite pleased Arizona s embattled former Sheriff Joe Arpaio volunteered look Barack Obama s birth certificate  Trump recently pardoned Arpaio criminal contempt conviction racial profiling case  calling  great American patriot  In previous life military officer  job preoccupied threats America s well being  And precisely reason current political rhetoric around race patriotism feels especially acute inappropriate  This tactic the attempt disentangle blackness patriotism America is extremely dangerous  It born ugliest parts history presents dire threat political stability  Let us never forget thing ever broken Union half question I began with  Should thing black American  We went war question  More 600 000 countrymen died question  A president assassinated question  The notion black American controversial Founding Fathers avoided altogether  Citizens turned guns other  Racist state regimes violently suppressed constitutional rights  And Army s elite 101st Airborne Division deployed nine black teenagers could go high school Little Rock  Arkansas  So patriotism black Americans questioned even it s done simply reframe debate favorable terms avoid uncomfortable conversations race the nation s worst impulses resurface  It fosters perception black people United States less American white neighbors  Being seen less American means one less claim citizenship  civil protections equal opportunity  It s creates voting laws complicate voting process black communities instead making easier  It s rationale aggressive policing minority communities  It s core view black achievement United States isn t product intellect hard work  white magnanimity  And veteran  I take deep offense attempt separate blackness America patriotism  Black people United States fought every war since nation s inception even could access citizenship  Black troops left families  took arms foreign shores  risked lives idea  promise  They fought Revolutionary War American independence  War 1812 American self determination Spanish American War 1898 American expansion all hopes service would compel nation recognize rights full citizenship  What higher form American patriotism fighting inalienable rights life  liberty pursuit happiness can t access it  That Spirit  76 led nation s creation  And  necessity  spirit still much alive well black America yet realize fullness American promise  These signs lesser Americans  signature superlative citizens  And yet  despite fighting unrealized freedoms  scores black veterans returning home conflict denied access veterans benefits rights full American citizenship  Jehu Grant enslaved man Rhode Island fought Continental Army  But Congress passed Pension Act 1832  Grant s annuity denied America determined slaves couldn t soldiers  When black World War II vets returned home  nearly denied access GI Bill  helped white veterans buy homes get education helped create atrocious racial wealth gap today  This happens black people even willing put lives line aren t seen real Americans  This this inability allow black Americans fully black fully American is national weakness  And enemies know it  The recent revelations Russia took fake ads Facebook used fake Twitter accounts exacerbate racial tensions United States come surprise  The fact countries long sought exploit racial discrimination order weaken United States shocking  Racism fault line  Achilles  heel  So tactic labeling black citizens critical government leaders un American dangerous ground  It playing fire that s consumed us past one domestic threat dismantle us again  I worried country  Not myopic lazy politicians decide play people s fears prejudices win elections  Not white nationalists march across university campuses discount Tiki torches  Not polarized politics side sees evil destructive  I worried country yet decided whether black American paradox fellow citizen  We cannot both  history proved country cannot survive former  Either United States

Hank Montalbano  held blameless investigation  also left Green Berets MBA candidate University Washington  Brandon Branch  also faulted report  medically retired due injuries sustained Afghanistan  He

qualifications  He transferred Air National Guard recently helped manage rescue helicopters Hurricane Harvey  The B 1 aircrew  re training  cleared fly again  As bomber s targeting system   still

A Seahawks  running back situation  Answering pressing questions,Will Thomas Rawls start week  Can Chris Carson really make back season  You questions  We answers  Eddie Lacy starting one week  Thomas Rawls next  Mike Davis roster  C J  Prosise off  And coach Pete Carroll saying there s chance Chris Carson could make back season  There s lot news Seattle s running back position late  So here s attempt sort question and answer form  Q  Briefly recap Seattle s running back situation looks like week  A  The Seahawks four 53 man roster   Rawls  Lacy  J D  McKissic Davis  Three others Injured Reserve   Carson  Prosise Tre Madden  fullback placed IR last week calf injury  Q  Players injured reserve return later season  correct  A  Yes  Rule changes last years mean two players IR return season long sat eight weeks  they return practice six  And teams longer declare players return put IR  So Seattle players placed IR season  a list also includes defensive end Cliff Avril  return eight weeks  assuming healthy enough team wants activate them  Q  And Carroll said week Carson Prosise could candidates return IR help team later season  A  He did  Carroll  fact  Tuesday referred Carson Prosise  a race  make back  Per IR rules  Carson  ankle surgery following injury Colts Oct  1  could return game Philadelphia Dec  3  Prosise  placed IR Tuesday high ankle sprain  couldn t return week divisional round playoffs  he miss last seven games plus first week playoffs  So either case Carroll basically saying maybe one other  both  could help postseason  But you re hoping Carson could make back help fantasy league team late season  may luck  Here s Carroll said Monday Prosise   The time frame like six week time frame right now  racing  I say optimism  Chris Carson see comes back first  We see happens road  With thought hopefully chance keep playing got games left see happens get there  And specifically Carson  Carroll said   He looks good working out  I m pretty optimistic him  I m hoping make back finish football year  I don t know  I m looking C J  We see happens  And docs would mad telling that  I m hoping happening  heck  Q  How tailback rotation work week  A  Rawls  recall  started Arizona Lacy started Washington suffered groin injury first quarter  Lacy s status unclear week   Carroll didn t want talk much injuries Tuesday team won t hold first full practice Atlanta Monday nighter Thursday  But assumption Rawls start Lacy coming injury  If Lacy play maybe rotates in  McKissic figures take Prosise s third down two minute back fulltime rest season  granted  already sort Prosise played five games  sparingly two those  Davis used roles   early downs third downs   preseason figures mix spots  Q  If I pick one Seattle tailback fantasy team week be  A  Well  first  point you re depending Seattle running back save things probably trouble  Russell Wilson continues lead Seahawks rushing 290 yards making Seattle team NFL quarterback leading rusher  Carson  played first four games  still leading rusher among Seattle tailbacks 208 yards followed Lacy  128  Rawls  125  For week  though  best bet probably remains Rawls  gotten bulk work last two weeks  even it s far statistically impressive  Rawls gained 27 yards 10 carries Arizona   23 coming one run  That means Rawls four yards nine carries  illustrating well Seattle continues trouble negative plays  Rawls 66 yards 19 carries last two games since Lacy went down  Seattle undoubtedly give Davis looks see do  showed promise preseason team high 106 yards 26 carries  But one note caution hoping Davis fix everything Seattle s running game remembering preseason success doesn t always translate regular season  Troymaine Pope Christine Michael rushing standouts past years longer league  Q  Is Seattle really going without fullback  A  For appears plan  Madden played 67 snaps seven games season  with high 15 Houston  indicating fullback position wasn t huge part offense year  Madden  though  also key special teams player 150 snaps there  Seattle often uses two  three tight end sets well eligible tackle sets try get additional blocking could make use formations true fullback  And knows  Maybe Seattle adds fullback road   former Husky Marcel Reece  played four games Seattle last year camp season released cutdown 53  remains town available  name one possible option  Q  Maybe important all  Seahawks truly get running game going rest season  A  Hard really answer given we ve seen far  Seattle averaging 100 7 yards per game season  22nd NFL barely better 99 4 year ago  Last year s struggles  though  blamed large part Wilson s injuries inability run  That s case year Wilson already surpassed rushing total last season  290 year 259 last season  Take Wilson s yards Seattle gained 616 yards 187 carries  3 2 per attempt  Seattle also two rushing touchdowns   Miami  one  fewer Giants team two  Those kind offenses Seattle wants keep company  maybe hardly needs said also un Carroll era Seattle type numbers   Seahawks scored least 13 rushing TDs every season since 2010 high 20 2014  How close Seahawks get making running game looking little like old self could big key success anything else final seven games ,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

compels find deliver solutions help prevent future loss life  Unfortunately  country deal loss life gun violence far often  It become rampant  epidemic country experiences  Two five deadliest US shootings modern history happened last 35 days  After every mass shooting  I hear arguments become familiar since Sandy Hook  Some argue  gun control   gun freedom  Others like aren t arguing gun  rather focusing person behind gun violent actions could prevented  As quickly debate guns starts  ends  These horrific attacks fade news headlines quickly  told  Now time talk gun violence  The time

health conditions much likely victims violence perpetrate it  likely hurt rather hurt others  In fact  mental illness contributes less 6  gun violence  The truth mismanaged uninterrupted fear anger  coupled nearly unfettered access guns happened Texas  sadly mass shootings  It s fear anger often escalates point person sees path ahead except self harm violence others  Often  shooters give warning

Special contributor Contact Bob Sturm Twitter   SportsSturm The Marinelli Report It pretty difficult analyze job defense 27 7 loss Atlanta own  Honestly  defense put together quite month since bye week  didn t allowed previous three opponents get 20 points 325 yards total offense  In dispensing 49ers  Redskins Chiefs  Cowboys started find form wasn t lost anyone team seemed feed presence leader best player  Sean Lee  In following European soccer scene  always enjoyable pick differences vernacular overall way explaining components game  One thing routinely use communicate meaning one player team s success term  talisman  defined Google Dictionary  an object  typically inscribed ring stone  thought magic powers bring good luck   So and so talisman  Without him  different team  him  conquer world  I think steal it  And  perhaps best explains place Cowboys currently in  Because clearly  Lee talisman  He left game eight defensive snaps Sunday  David Irving making fine tackle loss snap saw Lee leave field again  You see Lee pull up  realize happened  walk dejectedly sideline Irving celebrates another monster play 3 technique spot  The Cowboys may eventually caved Falcons Sunday Lee  That good team home  rough place get win  But left  trend Cowboys stopping run evident  Atlanta got rolling scored touchdowns three next four drives Cowboys tried scramble fill gap Jaylon Smith  They took chance Justin Durant active placing heavy workload Jaylon Smith put defense right back Rams Packers   issues linebacker position  Is Lee great  Is Jaylon Smith poor  Both  Somehow  seems go  well average   well average  one man replacing another  Ugh  It staggering reality that  strained hamstring  Lee miss Philadelphia  LA Chargers Washington games  They make sure healthy reintroduce back in  But pedestrian without him  WEEKLY DATA BOX Many numbers average  Not horrendous  good   336 yards allowed would expect Atlanta  You want get field third red zone minimal damage  Cowboys poor   Matt Ryan good   situations  The Cowboys limited big plays big damage  death 1 000 paper cuts Falcons kept moving chains two explosives  one sack allowed one giveaway  The defense helped poor offensive effort  see defense definitely best protected Cowboys offense takes game scruff neck  Perhaps different Tyron Smith Ezekiel Elliott  We speculate  But know team without talisman  Once Lee left game  Falcons took low risk approach success  MATT RYAN THROW CHART No real fireworks show  No Julio Jones feeding frenzy  Just spreading defense finding weak spot keep moving chains  This Falcons  easy day  really need anything hand Cowboys rope wait hang themselves  They complied  EXPLOSIVES DEFENSIVE SNAP COUNTS SPLASH PLAYS   WEEK 10   ATLANTA Interestingly enough  look defensive performance  see Cowboys  won  great number defensive snaps  Ten different plays tackles loss stuffed runs  That really impressive  But 34 runs mean 24 snaps  6 yards per carry  So  bad  good enough win  SPLASH PLAY SEASON TOTALS Lots progress fine play Anthony Hitchens  start tape section below  This important development going hope team without Lee around rest month  Here meets Tevin Coleman hole Coleman tries cut back  He isn t going get anywhere Irving waiting  I love watching Hitchens  No  59  see play  know play hit hole aggressiveness  There indecision hesitancy  it  Love see Hitchens look good  Look this  Here shooting behind slanting defensive line  Again  No  59  Directness  Explosiveness  He knows seeing knows role seek destroy  Here  DeMarcus Lawrence demonstrating dominance  I ask lock Hitchens watch work around right tackle  supposed him  He makes No  73 miss locks back suddenness real impressive directness  I love again  Hitchens it  Here edge tied tight end right tackle  He stick Terron Ward edge  better good speed get blocker let Ward turn corner quickness  Again  help  Hitchens giving even though score starting get away  Compete level  high  One I let go  Here Hitchens taking lead fullback  shedding making stop  This top level linebacker play far I concerned  I admit losing Lee hurts plenty  I think find encouragement Hitchens appears developed really help guy need worry anymore  Except may need new contract  I don t think want lose spring  Now plays  Here Lawrence taking lead league sacks  Who thought would saying November  The strength rush difficult tackle handle  It remarkable turned into  Here another sign defense quite good front  Here Maliek Collins  No  96  Irving  95  beating guys point attack getting backfield  Irving ends another play  How soon start talking among best 3 techniques sport  I wonder  He developed fast  Ryan Schraeder  No  73  rough day  You probably saw TV  Jaylon Smith  No  54  looks way sorts here  Not fill gap point attack  also takes Hitchens  This rather simple zone run side I linebacker spot  Hitchens still busting tail get there  Coleman hole secondary  Not great  Irving looks like got held here  too  seldom called run tackles  Here  run outside exposes Taco Charlton  No  97  getting sucked inside upfield  Jaylon Smith hung traffic  poor tackling corner defensive backs  My issue Jaylon Smith right guard supposed block never really even touch Smith slow react  You can t linebackers trailing play like badly unless getting blocked  He navigate traffic certainly isn t easy  job  Here another run blocked really well Atlanta  Can Jaylon Smith tight end get block least slow flow play gets space  Byron Jones first defensive back scene see Falcons love run 11 Personnel empty box six defenders  really isolate weak link perceive  This looks like man coverage and  yes  looks like probably another attack Jaylon Smith  tight end comes across flow play get space race pylon  Here end zone view  It isn t better view  The speed difference rather staggering  Here another  Right gut  Tough see exactly causing busts specifically 11 guys jobs do  But clear opponents want attack moment Lee goes away  clear gets fixed moment steps field    You get idea  You also know I massive fan Jaylon Smith s seeing story develop something great  But Durant active turned real big deal Sunday  Lee now  Hitchens Durant working together may Cowboys  hope keeping train tracks rest November ,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

calling white Rhodesians maintain standards  primitive country  Smith saw apostle Cecil John Rhodes  British magnate gave Rhodesia name  late nineteenth century duped black tribal leaders signing fertile land white pioneers  Although Rhodesia 1965 home 200 000 whites four million blacks  Smith shared Rhodes s belief black majority rule would occur  never thousand years  Smith course wrong  In

  I hope I don t sound arrogant  said   but won t find better run piece land  Smith insists Mugabe banned politics  1987  glad opportunity return full time farming  But Zimbabwe  whites owned finest farmland blacks remained dispossessed two decades independence  politics land became inseparable  A days visit Smith reading morning newspaper came across government notice listing latest batch farms

 Five ten years say   What man saying true  In era international justice  dictators blood hands afraid relinquish power  end prosecuted  like Slobodan Milosevic  humiliated  like Augusto Pinochet  Mugabe knows massacres carefully documented survivors human rights investigators  right nervous  Tsvangirai  part  might willing accept deal Mugabe given golden parachute Nigeria  as Charles Taylor

Blame imperialists Following lead British Prime Minister Tony Blair  United States Europe imposed sanctions Mugabe seventy four members inner circle  freezing assets  imposing travel ban  forbidding

Indians  Aborigines  Eskimos dare tell us land  asked  Like Castro Cuba  Mugabe admired developing world flouting Western powers  The foreigner could wield influence Zimbabwe South African President Thabo Mbeki  But Mbeki  insisted  softly  softly  approach  often seems simply stalling Mugabe s behalf  In September  Zimbabwe worst condition since Mugabe came power  Mbeki said things normalized  Although African National Congress benefited sanctions fight apartheid  called termination Zimbabwe  When  2002  Tony Blair persuaded Commonwealth Nations suspend Zimbabwe  Mbeki urged Britain one

anti imperial grounds  But although Mugabe s neighbors Africa may applaud President international conferences  privately taking steps protect Zimbabwean catastrophe  So many Zimbabwean refugees flood South Africa Mbeki grants entry produce bank statement proving financial solvency deposit  Z 300 000  His government also deports several thousand illegal Zimbabwean immigrants week  Botswana found

investors  tourists  Still  Mugabe last word Zimbabwe s fate  His cronies clearly worried clings power indefinitely  ruling party sink him  He pressure choose successor end year  But seventy nine  Mugabe may well decide stick around  relying though would never admit it on United States Britain bail people food aid  If hangs on  African leaders don t force out  Zimbabwe may go one two directions  Its destitute citizens might preoccupied finding food staying alive increasingly tune politics out  Over time memory of and sense entitlement to a better life give way  docilely submit authorities whose power increase crisis deepens  Or country s appalling conditions might stir domestic revolution  fourth chimurenga  bring Mugabe ruling party  The stakes small  Mugabe one last surviving members

wrinkle United States talks climate change 2017  tension fundamental issue s politics widely ignored  On one hand  Democrats party climate change  Since 1990s  public belief global warming become strongly polarized  Democratic Party emerged advocate aggressive climate action  The recent Democratic president made climate policy centerpiece second term  party s national politicians lament oppose undoing work  Concern climate isn t elite issue  either  Rank and file Democrats likely worry global warming median voter  On hand  Democratic Party plan address climate change  This true almost every level policy making process  It consensus bill issue waiting wings  shared vision bill could look like  guiding slogan like  Medicare all to express wants stop global warming  Many people party know want something climate change  there s agreement something may be  This lack trying  Democrats struggled formulate post Obama climate policy substantive political obstacles stand way  They yet identified mechanism make dent Earth s costly  irreversible warming uniting many factions coalition  These problems could keep party scrambling face climate crisis years come        The roots crisis go back 2009  Democrats held unified control White House Congress  The end last decade unique moment climate politics  Thanks string intense hurricane years  unexpected success Al Gore s documentary An Inconvenient Truth  public support addressing climate change legislation higher ever been  Democrats responded American Clean Energy Security Act  widely known  Waxman Markey  two sponsors  Congressmen Henry Waxman California Edward Markey Massachusetts  The bill proposed creating carbon emissions trading market across United States  Under terms  government would distributed number  right emit carbon  credits companies  could bought sold other  As years passed  government would allot fewer credits  forcing price emitting carbon increase  would in theory ultimately decrease amount carbon dioxide released atmosphere  When Waxman Markey failed  pan Democratic consensus fell apart it  Though little technical  pollution market proven idea U S  environmental law  George H W  Bush established similar  cap and trade  system presidency reduce pollutants create acid rain  In June 2009  Waxman Markey passed House  But summer wore on  bill s prospects floundered  By August  Tea Party rose command media attention  public opinion turned Democrats  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid focused passing would become Affordable Care Act declined take climate bill Senate floor  By middle next summer  Waxman Markey effectively dead  Only years opened  window pass climate legislation already shut  Even defeat  Waxman Markey cost party dearly  More two dozen congressional Democrats supported cap and trade bill lost 2010 midterm election  The casualties included Rick Boucher  14 term veteran Congress whose district included much southwest Virginia s coal country  Boucher negotiated concessions local coal companies Waxman Markey  could save seat  Ten House Democrats  including Boucher  voted Waxman Markey Affordable Care Act  Six lost seats 2010  Indeed  Democrats seemed prevail ran climate bill  Joe Manchin  Democratic governor West Virginia  special election year serve Senate  ran ad showed shooting pile paper rifle   I sued EPA  I ll take dead aim cap and trade bill  said commercial  received wide media coverage  So Waxman Markey failed  And then  freed unified campaign  American progressives took climate policy two different directions  Many activists came see climate change one symptom dehumanized capitalism  First  Obama administration pressed ahead plans use Clean Air Act limit carbon dioxide   This power predated presidency  In 2007  Supreme Court told EPA must consider regulating greenhouse gases law  This push eventually produced Clean Power Plan 2015  set rules meant reduce greenhouse gas emissions power sector 30 percent historic peak  Though dominated press coverage Obama s climate policy  Clean Power Plan never actually took effect  In February 2016  Supreme Court blocked gaining force law  But administration got many rules aimed drawing carbon pollution books end Obama s term  Second  swath environmentalists abandoned hope passing climate legislation returned grassroots  project by project approach  Instead reducing greenhouse gas emissions law  activists hoped deprive oil companies social license operate altogether  Chief among new groups 350 org  led author Bill McKibben  350 opposed Keystone XL pipeline  mega infrastructure project linked Canadian tar sands U S  export terminals  warning completion would spell  game climate  In 2010  Sierra Club also began use environmental litigation public pressure shut hundreds coal burning power plants part Beyond Coal campaign  This climate antagonism one aspect left s general resurgence period  Inspired part Naomi Klein s 2014 book This Changes Everything  many activists came see climate change one symptom dehumanized extractive capitalism  These two sides even something proxy battle 2016 Democratic primary  During race  Hillary Clinton opposed carbon tax endorsed Obama administration s ongoing regulatory efforts  Sanders endorsed carbon tax called aggressive investment climate mitigation  Unlike Clinton s policies  Sanders would surely required Democratic Congress enshrine policies  In ways  though  2016 primary imperfect battleground climate policy  Sanders seek energy economist s ideal climate policy  He wedded climate hawk positions like opposition natural gas fracking to 1970s  classically green opposition nuclear power   Even though proposed carbon tax would greatest boon nuclear power industry decades  nuclear plants emit greenhouse gases  Democratic voters still don t care climate change much  And likely would little substantive policy difference either candidate s presidency  least first  Had Clinton Sanders election  EPA would dutifully defended Clean Power Plan court  And administration would benefited one liberal seat Supreme Court help enshrine aggressive climate protections law  But Trump won  And brings us present        On October 10  Scott Pruitt formally repealed Clean Power Plan  first phase planned disembowelment Obama s environmental legacy  Pruitt assured succeed effort  Many environmental lawyers argue legal arguments particularly well supported  To push repeal through  Pruitt muck EPA s internal cost benefit calculations  His EPA changed estimates social harms carbon dioxide  calculating number 50 times smaller Obama administration used  also changed values threat air pollution poses American public  It may naught  Some environmentalists argue Clean Power Plan already accomplished main goal  sending anti coal price signal utility managers  Michael Bloomberg  UN special climate envoy former New York mayor  argued falling cost renewable energy availability cheap  bountiful natural gas help United States meet carbon reduction goals even without federal policy  But Pruitt need win total victory succeed  The Clean Power Plan repeal litigated court  EPA lobbying side deregulation  The fight last years  It may even wind front Supreme Court conservative now  The new environmental antagonism seem run directly counter worker interests  No one knows future  it s hard sketch possibilities  Pruitt may well secure ruling effectively keeps Clean Air Act ever regulating greenhouse gases  Even fails  future Trump EPA may succeed permanently limiting law s regulatory power  And climate concerned Democrat next enters White House  whether 2020  2024  2028  may find Obama administration s main policy implement fighting carbon emissions dulled uselessness  Attorneys future EPA will  point  probably improvise new way address climate change regulation  They choice  But likely need  too  new legislation  What Democrats do        Democrats face least three major problems trying formulate climate policy  First  relationship environmentalists labor groups disintegrated since 2009  Once upon time  unions widely supported Waxman Markey  The bill funded assistance workers put work transition away fossil fuels launched  green job  retraining programs  It also provided tens billions funding  carbon capture sequestration  experimental technology would possibly allowed coal plants keep running  But failed  pan Democratic consensus fell apart it  Neither two climate strategies succeeded Waxman Markey offer particular appeal organized labor  The Clean Power Plan essentially made nonprofits already strapped state budgets  in GOP governed states  responsible softening economic blow carbon regulation  In large part  declined  The antagonistic approach pipelines fossil fuel projects also alienated labor  Construction union workers still spend much time building pipelines installing renewables  Divorced unified legislative campaign and promise federal funding the new environmental antagonism seem run directly counter worker interests  Many voters trust Democrats legislative plan resolve climate crisis  This isn t necessarily fault antagonists alone  Unionization renewable industry also lagging  Renewable energy companies often anti union California based tech firm  In October  instance  Tesla which swears trying hire employees fast can fired 400 700 workers many analysts understood union busting move  United Auto Workers filed complaint National Labor Relations Board  Green energy companies don t harbor anti regulatory  Silicon Valley style dislike organized labor  They also see fighting desperate battle price oil gas companies  Every cent union might add production cost  argue  cent disadvantages fossil fuels  The green labor breakdown party s biggest political obstacle  But second problem Democratic voters still don t care climate change much  Like Americans  party s electorate experience  low intensity  issue  Though majority Americans every state believe climate change  people use climate policy decide vote for  Even Democrats say candidate s proposed climate policy matters less making voting decision proposed policies jobs  health care  economy  education  income inequality  terrorism  As happens  Trump helping solve problem  Due steady siege Obama era climate policy  seems motivating rank and file Democrats address issue  His withdrawal Paris Agreement much unpopular treaty itself  But remains unclear whether passage climate policy motivates supporters aggravates alienates issue s  anti constituency   such coal oil workers  Finally  dealing climate change policy hard  Most good news climate change lately come power sector  emissions dropped 18 percent last five years  But electricity production makes 29 percent total U S  greenhouse gas emissions  For United States decarbonize which even newest optimistic projections say must proceed historically unprecedented pace it must also tackle carbon pollution sectors  If Democrats win Congress White House  history suggests get sliver time commit kind new policy statute  Those sectors tougher crack  Most emissions transportation sector  which makes quarter U S  greenhouse gas pollution  come cars trucks  In order draw emissions 2050  consumers opt electric vehicles en masse service stations erect electric chargers across country  Analysts say that s unlikely occur without large public investment  And ideas tackle 21 percent U S  emissions come industrial manufacturing sector        These questions pressing seem  Eighteen months now  Democratic policy advisers meet develop chosen candidate s primary policies  If Democrats win unified control Congress White House in  say  2020  history suggests get sliver time commit kind new policy statute public opinion turns them  During window  dozens issues compete law makers  attention  In light  consider Democrats treated health care past 10 months  While there s party wide consensus  small groups voters around country organized around issue  calling senators every day months  More third Democratic senators supported bill introduce single national health insurer  And Bernie Sanders  party s 2020 frontrunner  debated Trumpcare  in many forms  CNN several times  In sum  many Democrats coalesced around single phrase  if quite policy accompany it  promised deliver next time they re power  And even Democrats see  Medicare All  base play as slogan likely deployed Vermont Colorado it remains policy focused promise future governance  The party similar promises issues  too  On immigration  promise DREAM Act  LGBT rights  Equality Act  I suspect many voters  including rank and file Democrats  believe there s similar strategy climate change  They think there s bill waiting wings would address issue  They trust Democrats legislative plan resolve climate crisis  party needs granted control Congress pass it  The days climate only bill passed  But nothing similar scale exists  Senate s vocal Democrats issue resist formulating one  Sheldon Whitehouse  delivers weekly climate themed haranguing Senate floor  recently told Vox s Jeff Stein way
