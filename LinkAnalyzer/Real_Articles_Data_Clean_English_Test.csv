OxyContin  The Sacklers disregarded recommendation  2004 Blumenthal filed complaint Purdue  behalf State Connecticut  It cited data indicating fifth OxyContin prescriptions dosing intervals shorter twelve hours  In fact  Blumenthal obtained Purdue records indicating company officials knew 1998 prescriptions eight hour intervals becoming frequent  In one document  Purdue employee called numbers  very scary  Such alarm off label dosing may prompted less concern public health considerations profit  If OxyContin widely prescribed intervals fewer twelve hours  company might lose  two pills day  marketplace advantage cheaper alternatives  like generic morphine  insurers could start refusing cover costs  As early 1997  benefit plans begun citing abuse OxyContin excuse pay  In 1997 e mail

Paul Hanly  lawyer  said Sacklers  steadfast refusal address legacy OxyContin may legal tactic and shrewd one   The interviews give  targets create lawyers like me  government investigators  said  I wondered whether philanthropy might represent  least Sacklers  form atonement  But  consider breadth family s donations  one field conspicuously lacking  addiction treatment  measures might serve counter opioid epidemic  In August  2010  Purdue quietly replaced OxyContin drug subtly different  The company granted patents reformulated version OxyContin  If crushed new pills  became fine  dissolvable powder unwieldy gummy substance  Purdue received F D A  approval reformulation  part  touting ostensible safety new product  The F D A  approved label  first kind  included claim drug s  abuse deterrent  properties  In interview  Craig Landau  Purdue s C E O  told me   A large proportion Purdue s R    D  efforts post 2001 dedicated toward addressing specific vulnerability original OxyContin product  To casual observer  might seemed makers OxyContin  years obstructing efforts curb disastrous impacts painkiller  finally seen error ways  But Purdue almost certainly motivated another consideration  needed block competition generic drugs  Arthur Sackler often used pages Medical Tribune criticize generics  In 1985  paper published story   Schizophrenics  Wild  Weak Generic  describing  all hell broke loose  veterans  hospital psychiatric unit switched brand name antipsychotic generic    According Times   F D A  investigated found story bogus   the generic introduced six months purported problems began  I spoke leading patent lawyer frequently represents manufacturers generic drugs  said companies often make minor tweak branded product shortly patent expires  order

reformulated drug  company filed papers F D A  asking agency refuse accept generic versions original formulation because unsafe  The F D A  ever obliging  agreed  blocking low cost generic competition Purdue  For year  Purdue continued sell original formulation OxyContin Canada  According recent study  OxyContin sales Windsor  Ontario just across border Detroit suddenly quadrupled  clear indication pills purchased U S  black market  Through I M S  tracking data  Purdue would able monitor Canadian surge  deduce reason it   The company acknowledges aware spike sales  maintains alerted authorities  say so  By time Purdue reformulated OxyContin  country middle full blown epidemic  Andrew Kolodny  addiction specialist  told many older people remain addicted reformulated OxyContin  continue obtain

So Purdue  When first introduced OxyContin  company created program encouraged doctors issue coupons free initial prescription  By time Purdue discontinued program  four years later  thirty four thousand coupons redeemed  Purdue Pharma acknowledges opioid crisis  maintains taken every available step address it  sponsoring  prescription monitoring  programs states underwriting drug abuse education  Craig Landau  C E O  told me   If Holy Grail pain medicine safe effective patients severe pain carries abuse risk  haven t found yet  He added company trying develop  non opioid pain products  Purdue likes emphasize many powerful painkillers  OxyContin never two per cent market opioids  This true terms number prescriptions  But painkillers prescribed short periods following surgery  instance and relatively small doses  whereas OxyContin s sales driven long term  high dose prescriptions  If one measured market share actual volume narcotics administered  OxyContin s would considerably higher  Some doctors I spoke estimated could high thirty per cent  The United States accounts roughly third global market opioid painkillers  But  politicians journalists raised alarms addiction crisis  many American doctors grown leery  again  prescribing drugs  In statement  Purdue acknowledged even patients  who take OxyContin accordance F D A approved labeling instructions likely develop physical dependence  The company maintains physical dependence different addiction  Jane Ballantyne  president Physicians Responsible Opioid Prescribing  said that  patients  meaningless distinction  find unable stop taking drug  fear crippling withdrawal   at certain point might well addiction  The drugstore chain CVS  accused profiteering opioids  recently announced plans limit prescriptions powerful doses one week s worth  change could major impact abuse drugs  It may also OxyContin achieved market saturation  In recent years  American clinicians issued quarter billion opioid prescriptions annually  Last year  Ohio  state particularly hard hit epidemic  2 3 million residents roughly one five people state received prescription opioids  In 2012  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel published story pain patients offered testimonials wonders OxyContin Purdue promotional videos  Johnny Sullivan  construction worker talked OxyContin easing back pain  became addicted

Juurlink  Toronto doctor  told opioids problematic even users don t succumb addiction   Opioids really afford pain relief initially  said   But relief tends diminish time  That s  part  people

primary benefit therapy  point  going withdrawal   This barn keep feelings  If feeling comes you  bring lock up  Even Russell Portenoy  Purdue funded doctor advocated wider long term use opioids  reassessed views   Did I teach pain management  specifically opioid therapy  way reflects misinformation  said Wall Street Journal 2012   I guess I did   In statement  Portenoy told  refocussed

taken responsibility similar spirit  apologizing role unleashing national catastrophe noting that  nineties  relied series mistaken assumptions safety OxyContin  But Purdue continued fight aggressively measures might limit distribution OxyContin  way calls mind gun lobby s resistance firearm regulations  Confronted prospect modest  commonsense measures might way impinge prescribing painkillers  Purdue various allies responded alarm  suggesting steps deny law abiding pain patients access medicine desperately need  Mark Sullivan  psychiatrist University Washington  distilled argument Purdue   Our product isn t dangerous it s people dangerous  Last year  C D C  formally declared opioid epidemic 2011  introduced first set guidelines help reduce prescribing strong painkillers like OxyContin   Opioids considered first line routine therapy chronic pain  guidelines said  recommending doctors first consider  non pharmacologic  approaches  physical therapy   non opioid pharmacologic  treatments  Purdue pharmaceutical companies long funded ostensibly neutral nonprofit groups advocate pain patients  The C D C  guidelines nonbinding  yet many organizations fought prevent agency releasing them  This kind obstruction typical state federal level  A recent series Associated Press Center Public Integrity revealed that  Purdue made guilty plea  2007  assembled army lobbyists fight legislative actions might encroach business  Between 2006 2015  Purdue painkiller producers  along associated nonprofits  spent nearly nine hundred million dollars lobbying political contributions eight times gun lobby spent period  Since Purdue made difficult grind OxyContin pills  prescriptions reportedly plummeted forty per cent  This suggests nearly half original drug s consumers may crushing get high  As David Juurlink pointed me  misnomer call reformulation  abuse deterrent  It still abused and is  widely  people become addicted swallowing pills

America  look abroad  After introducing OxyContin U S  Purdue moved Canada England  At University Toronto  company sponsored class pain management medical dental students  The instructor member Purdue

so  I d take extra precautions  chemicals used building could cause lenses liquefy fuse eyes  Inside  pipes snaked along walls overhead  The thrum machinery made hard hear  In one corner  looked like

They ve devised process allows them  effect  suck carbon dioxide air  Every day plant  roughly ton CO 2 previously floated Mt  Garibaldi Chief converted calcium carbonate  The pellets subsequently heated  gas forced off  stored cannisters  The calcium recovered  process run again   If we re successful building business around carbon removal  trillion dollar markets  Corless told me  This past April  concentration carbon dioxide atmosphere reached record four hundred ten parts per million  The amount CO 2 air probably greater it s time since mid Pliocene  three half million years ago  lot less ice poles sea levels sixty feet higher  This year s record surpassed next year  next year s year that  Even every country fulfills pledges made Paris climate accord and United States said doesn t intend to carbon dioxide could soon reach levels that  it s widely agreed  lead catastrophe  assuming hasn t already done so  Carbon dioxide removal is  potentially  trillion dollar enterprise offers way slow rise CO 2 reverse it  The process sometimes referred  negative emissions  instead adding carbon air  subtracts it  Carbon removal plants could built anywhere  everywhere  Construct enough and  theory least  CO 2 emissions could continue unabated still could avert calamity  Depending look things  technology represents either ultimate insurance policy ultimate moral hazard  Carbon Engineering one half dozen companies vying prove carbon removal feasible  Others include Global Thermostat  based New York  Climeworks  based near Zurich  Most owe origins ideas physicist named Klaus Lackner  works Arizona State University  Tempe  way home British Columbia I took detour visit him  It July  day I arrived temperature city reached hundred twelve degrees  When I got hotel  one first things I noticed dead starling lying  feet up  parking lot  I wondered died heat exhaustion  Lackner  sixty five  grew Germany  He tall lanky  fringe gray hair prominent forehead  I met office institute runs  Center Negative Carbon Emissions  The office bare  except New Yorker cartoons theme nerd dom  which  Lackner told me  wife cut him  In one  couple scientists stand front enormous whiteboard covered equations   The math right  one says   It s poor taste  In late nineteen seventies  Lackner moved Germany California study George Zweig  one discoverers quarks  A years later  got job Los Alamos National Laboratory  There  worked fusion   Some work classified  said   some not  Fusion process powers stars and  closer home  thermonuclear bombs  When Lackner Los Alamos  touted solution world s energy problem  fusion could harnessed  could generate vast amounts carbon free power using isotopes hydrogen  Lackner became convinced fusion reactor was  minimum  decades away   Decades later  it s generally agreed workable reactor still decades away  Meanwhile  globe s growing population would demand energy  demand would met  part  fossil fuels   I realized  probably earlier most  claims demise fossil fuels greatly exaggerated  Lackner told me   In fact  fossil fuels currently provide eighty per cent world s energy  Proportionally  figure hasn t changed much since mid eighties  but  global energy use nearly doubled  amount coal  oil  natural gas burned today almost two times greater  One evening early nineties  Lackner beer friend  Christopher Wendt  also physicist  The two got wondering why  Lackner put me   nobody s really crazy  big things anymore  This led questions conversations  and possibly beers  Eventually  two produced equation dense paper argued self replicating machines could solve world s energy problem and  less time  clean mess humans made burning fossil fuels  The machines would powered solar panels  multiplied they d produce solar panels  they d assemble using elements  like silicon aluminum  extracted ordinary dirt  The expanding collection panels would produce ever power  rate would increase exponentially  An array covering three hundred eighty six thousand square miles an area larger Nigeria but  Lackner Wendt noted   smaller many deserts could supply world s electricity many times over  This array could put use scrubbing carbon dioxide atmosphere  According Lackner Wendt  power generated Nigeria size solar farm would enough remove CO 2 emitted humans point within five years  Ideally  CO 2 would converted rock  similar white sand produced Carbon Engineering  enough would created cover Venezuela layer foot half deep   Where rock would go two specify  Lackner let idea self replicating machine slide  became intrigued carbon dioxide removal  particularly what s become known  direct air capture   Sometimes thinking extreme end point learn lot  said  He began giving talks writing papers subject  Some scientists decided nuts  others visionary   Klaus is  fact  genius  Julio Friedmann  former Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Energy expert carbon management  told me  In 2000  Lackner received job offer Columbia University  Once New York  pitched plan developing carbon sucking technology Gary Comer  founder Lands  End  Comer brought meeting investment adviser  quipped Lackner wasn t looking venture capital much  adventure capital  Nevertheless  Comer offered put five million dollars  The new company called Global Research Technologies  G R T  It got far building small prototype  looking new investors financial crisis hit   Our timing exquisite  Lackner told me  Unable raise funds  company ceased operations  As planet continued warm  carbon dioxide levels continued climb  Lackner came believe that  unwittingly  humanity already committed negative emissions   I think we re uncomfortable situation  said   I would argue technologies pull CO 2 environment fail we re deep trouble  Lackner founded Center Negative Carbon Emissions A S U  2014  Most equipment dreams put together workshop blocks office  The day I there  hot outside even five minute walk workshop required staging  Lackner delivered short lecture dangers dehydration handed bottle water  In workshop  engineer tinkering looked like guts foldout couch  Where  living room version  would mattress  one elaborate array plastic ribbons  Embedded ribbon powder made thousands upon thousands tiny amber colored beads  The beads  Lackner explained  could purchased truckload  composed resin normally used water treatment remove chemicals like nitrates  More less accident  Lackner discovered beads could repurposed  Dry  they d absorb carbon dioxide  Wet  they d release it  The idea expose ribbons Arizona s thirsty air  fold device sealed container filled water  The CO 2 captured powder dry phase would released wet phase  could piped container  whole process re started  couch folding unfolding again  Lackner calculated apparatus size semi trailer could remove ton carbon dioxide per day  three hundred sixty five tons year  The world s cars  planes  refineries  power plants produce thirty six billion tons CO 2 annually  so  told me   if built hundred million trailer size units could actually keep current emissions  He acknowledged figure sounded daunting  But  noted  iPhone around decade so  seven hundred million use   We still early game  said  The way Lackner sees things  key avoiding  deep trouble  thinking differently   We need change paradigm  told me  Carbon dioxide regarded way view waste products  like sewage garbage  We don t expect people stop producing waste   Rewarding people going bathroom less would nonsensical  Lackner observed  At time  don t let shit sidewalk toss empty yogurt containers street   If I tell garbage I m dumping front house twenty per cent less year last year  would still think I m something intolerable  Lackner said  One reasons we ve made little progress climate change  contends  issue acquired ethical charge  polarized people  To extent emissions seen bad  emitters become guilty   Such moral stance makes virtually everyone sinner  makes hypocrites many concerned climate change still partake benefits modernity  written  Changing paradigm  Lackner believes  change conversation  If CO 2 treated another form waste  disposed of  people stop arguing whether it s problem finally start something  Carbon dioxide  discovered  Scottish physician named Joseph Black  1754  A decade later  another Scotsman  James Watt  invented efficient steam engine  ushering called age industrialization future generations may dub age emissions  It likely end nineteenth century human activity raised average temperature earth tenth degree Celsius  or nearly two tenths degree Fahrenheit  As world warmed  started change  first gradually suddenly  By now  globe least one degree Celsius  1 8 degrees Fahrenheit  warmer Black s day  consequences becoming ever apparent  Heat waves hotter  rainstorms intense  droughts drier  The wildfire season growing longer  fires  like ones recently ravaged Northern California  numerous  Sea levels rising  rate rise accelerating  Higher sea levels exacerbated damage Hurricanes Harvey  Irma  Maria  higher water temperatures probably also made storms ferocious   Harvey climate change looks like  Eric Holthaus  meteorologist turned columnist  recently wrote  Meanwhile  still warming locked in  There s much inertia climate system  vast earth itself  globe yet fully adjust hundreds billions tons carbon dioxide added atmosphere past decades  It s calculated equilibrate current CO 2 levels planet still needs warm half degree  And every ten days another billion tons carbon dioxide released  Last month  World Meteorological Organization announced concentration carbon dioxide atmosphere jumped record amount 2016  No one say exactly warm world get disaster the inundation low lying cities  say  collapse crucial ecosystems  like coral reefs becomes inevitable  Officially  threshold two degrees Celsius  3 6 degrees Fahrenheit  preindustrial levels  Virtually every nation signed figure round climate negotiations held Cancún 2010  Meeting Paris 2015  world leaders decided two degree threshold high  stated aim climate accord hold  the increase global average temperature well 2 C  try limit 1 5 C  Since planet already warmed one degree and  practical purposes  committed another half degree  would seem impossible meet latter goal nearly impossible meet former  And nearly impossible  unless world switches course instead adding CO 2 atmosphere also starts remove it  The extent world counting negative emissions documented latest report Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change

increase two degrees Celsius  found math punishing  Global emissions would fall rapidly dramatically pretty much zero middle century   This would entail  among things  replacing world s power plants  revamping agricultural systems  eliminating gasoline powered vehicles  within next decades  Alternatively  humanity could  effect  go hock  It could allow CO 2 levels temporarily exceed two degree threshold a situation that s become known  overshoot and then  via negative emissions  pull excess CO 2 air  The I P C C  considered thousand possible scenarios  Of these  hundred sixteen limit warming two degrees  hundred eight involve negative emissions  In many below two degree scenarios  quantity negative emissions called reaches order magnitude  positive  emissions produced today   The volumes outright crazy  Oliver Geden  head E U  research division German Institute International Security Affairs  told me  Lackner said   I think I P C C  really saying  We tried lots lots scenarios  and  scenarios stayed safe  virtually every one needed magic touch negative emissions  If didn t that  ran brick wall    Pursued scale envisioned I P C C  carbon dioxide removal would yield first tens billions soon hundreds billions tons CO 2   would dealt with  This represents supersized challenge  CO 2 combined calcium produce limestone  process Carbon Engineering  and Lackner s self replicating machine scheme  But necessary form calcium isn t readily available  producing generally yields CO 2   self defeating prospect  An alternative shove carbon back came from  deep underground   If storing

  Greenberg added   Like Nick said  it s matter whether society we re going it  When work began Decatur project  2003  people besides Klaus Lackner thinking sucking CO 2 air  Instead  goal demonstrate

smokestack consumes lot power up twenty five per cent total produced typical coal burning plant  And this  course  translates costs  What company going assume costs dump CO 2 air free   If you re

company employee  Vandermeyden  thirty years old  working pharmaceutical sales representative since shortly college  wanted different kind job  seemed center world Silicon Valley  She knew Tesla s ambitious  eccentric co founder Elon Musk managing companies devoted space flight solar energy  addition running Tesla  producing electric cars  inspired mission  Tesla growing quickly offered numerous opportunities employees advance  The company  Musk liked say   meritocracy  Vandermeyden wanted part it  Vandermeyden saw man wearing Tesla T shirt walked introduce herself  After found worked sales  department wanted join  decided deliver pitch right then  He seemed impressed nerve  A weeks later  hired Tesla product specialist inside sales department  At first  Vandermeyden thrived Tesla  After almost year  promoted job engineering project coördinator paint department  The new position involved working Tesla s automotive manufacturing facility Fremont  California  hundreds apple red robot arms assembled Tesla vehicles white factory floor  The whirr robots motion gave plant feel something science fiction  But even futuristic environment something life Tesla seemed distinctly atavistic and deeply wrong  Vandermeyden  worked closely group eight employees  soon learned salary lower everyone else group  including several new hires come Tesla straight college  She was  happened  woman group  Her supervisors  supervisors  supervisors  male  way chain  seemed  Musk himself   Sorry missed heist we got sidetracked Roscoe smelled truffles  At Tesla  many tech companies  gallows humor prevailed among women  There sense male executives little understanding challenges women faced company  One former Tesla employee told women made less ten per cent working group  one point  actually men named Matt group women  This became source rueful comedy  One male colleague quipped change sign reading  Women s Room   Matt s Room  Vandermeyden dedicated employee  Before long  manager general assembly division  heard Vandermeyden worked twenty six hours straight particular project  persuaded switch group  She started wearing steel toed boots safety glasses work  She noticed sometimes  female employees walked certain areas plant  male workers whistled  catcalled  made derogatory comments  Women called  predator zone  In July  2015  three months Vandermeyden joined team  several male colleagues promoted  Although impression would shortly receive promotion raise  get either  according court documents  She e mailed boss  listing accomplishments reminding performance reviews positive  He didn t seem taking concerns seriously  started copying human resources department e mails  She scheduled meeting boss s boss  cancelled last minute  left town two weeks vacation  Finally  two months later  Vandermeyden s managers told that  order given raise  would increase rate production line hundred per cent within year  This aggressive  probably unrealistic  goal  Vandermeyden felt  couldn t help thinking company setting failure  would cause fire her  She decided consult lawyer  On September 20  2016  Vandermeyden filed lawsuit charging Tesla sex discrimination  retaliation  workplace violations  Since October  dozens women went public accusations harassment assault Harvey Weinstein  problem sexual harassment become central topic national conversation  After long silence  women come forward make allegations powerful figures  including film director James Toback  head Amazon Studios  Roy Price  political analyst Mark Halperin  new names added every days  Many alleged abuses taken place entertainment business  seems almost uniquely structured facilitate exploitation women  generations young actresses trying climb career ladder built controlled male producers directors  But allegations areas  academia local government corporate offices  made clear broader American workplace resembles Hollywood people previously acknowledged  After revelations Weinstein others revelations included harrowing stories rape assault  Weinstein others deny issues like unequal pay lack promotion might seem minor comparison  They aren t  course  Weinstein level problems but problems create men like Weinstein  It s imbalance pay power puts men position harass  gives unchecked control economic lives women and  result  influence physical lives  These subtler forms discrimination  familiar almost woman held job  fact especially insidious  since easier companies  even victims  dismiss  This problem perhaps nowhere evident technology industry  In 2015  group

Men era  without skinny ties Martini lunches  Tesla s situation shows heavily male dominated enterprise even highly innovative one can leave women feeling powerless  After Vandermeyden filed lawsuit  word gradually spread throughout company  A months later  e mail went Tesla s internal group female employees  inviting event celebrate International Women s Day  The event attended vice presidents senior executives  one woman   There around forty five V P s Tesla time  two women  according person familiar company  The meeting quickly became tense  Several female engineers spoke equal pay  pressed company disclose compensation numbers male female workers  An employee named Justine announced   I ll shortly leaving Tesla environment  As I look leaders front row  I see common theme  white

say   Harassment wrong  discrimination wrong  He brought bunch people onstage said   If try hard  succeed    She continued   How much harder try get everyone else there  So question is  Is priority Elon  Because Elon doesn t care won t happen  The moderator meeting read comments female staff members Tesla s Gigafactory  facility based Nevada produces batteries Tesla cars  Women said didn t know

Munoz case  no allegation evidence romantic sexual relationship Mr  Cagney employee  Charles said wrote memo outlining fraud allegations sent superiors SoFi  He felt strongly right thing  Still  said   I sure I going get fired  At first  appeared company taking allegations seriously  During meeting early April  vice president human resources told Charles allegations manipulation loans increase

Trump declared America s opioid epidemic national public health emergency  President s Commission Combating Drug Addiction Opioid Crisis released final set policy recommendations   The panel called Congress White House consider fifty six proposals  among streamlining federal funding addiction treatment  instituting stricter prison sentences opioid traffickers  launching  aggressive  TV social media campaign dissuade children teens taking drugs   In earlier announcement  Trump promised  really tough  really big  really great advertising  get people start  The commission also urged Department Health Human Services develop  a national curriculum standard care opioid prescribers  supplement Centers Disease Control Prevention s existing guide primary care physicians  There doubt epidemic warrants urgent  wide ranging action  According recent C D C  report   twelve half million Americans misused prescription opioids 2015  latest year reliable figures available  three quarters million used heroin  All told  thirty three thousand people died opioid overdoses year  The situation appears worsening  provisional data suggests over all rate drug overdose deaths jumped twenty per cent 2016  substantial portion likely coming opioids  Trump repeatedly acknowledged scale problem  yet free funds address it  For now  seems interested another round  just say no  campaigns  nothing help already addicted  The idea creating curriculum opioid prescribers good one measures like already made drugs harder obtain but Administration must also work confront another obstacle within medical community  The fact that  many physicians  caring drug users source enormous frustration  This truth became vividly apparent early training  As intern Massachusetts General Hospital nineteen seventies  I called emergency room attend man twenties I call Vinny  He fever hundred four  struggling breathe  blood pressure falling  On physical examination  I heard loud heart murmur  indicating cardiac valves malfunctioning  Then I noticed several track marks arms  The diagnosis became apparent  Vinny injected heroin using dirty needle  introduced microbes directly bloodstream  landed inside heart  causing infection called bacterial endocarditis  The medical team moved Vinny intensive care unit stayed night  working keep going shock  In addition antibiotics  required numerous medications keep blood pressure up  By time sun rose  vital signs stable  I felt heroic  saved young man s life  When I exited I C U  tell distraught mother  burst tears kissed hands  In ensuing weeks  Vinny recovered  I got know well  He claimed shot drugs occasionally swore mother s life that  brush death  would never touch heroin again  But  less month later  back E R  spiking fever struggling breathe  Though hospital social worker put touch addiction clinic  continued using drugs  Again I C U  team best  Vinny survived  But I filled anger resentment  colleagues I lied to  taken charm  appeared time energy naught  My supervising resident told I naïve faith Vinny s promises  was  parlance resident  like addicts  S P O S a subhuman piece shit  The acronym still appalls me  four decades later  It betrayal spirit compassion good physicians must bring practice medicine  But I understood doctors I worked wanted nothing patients  I later heard Vinny died drug overdose  infecting girlfriend H I V  She ended succumbing AIDS    As happened  I would devote much career AIDS epidemic  Nearly patients eighties nineties gay men saw caregivers allies  As policymakers step efforts check opioid crisis  best support physicians front line  In August  two infectious disease specialists Boston s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center  I also work  took question New England Journal Medicine    At point

impractical love  And better part decade  Booker landed frequently particular phrase the  conspiracy love  It s phrase employs almost religious fervor a combination guiding light mantra permanent political slogan  He uses tell story  suburbs New York City Stanford Oxford Yale  He uses tell story family  poor  segregated South upwardly mobile comfort business intellectual elite  And Booker uses

Gorbatyuk told me   Right now  want speak Manafort  people from  Skadden witnesses  However  even getting point could question Manafort proven difficult  Under mutual legal agreement United States  Ukrainians contacted American counterparts December 2014 request help organize interview Skadden s lead lawyer report  former White House counsel Gregory Craig  followed another early 2015 asking talk

The rest  individual income tax side  benefit many   means   middle class  altogether  far benefit richest Americans more  according recent estimates  Meanwhile  majority poorest Americans would see little change tax bills  Altogether  House bill  around 70 percent tax benefits would initially flow people earning six figures per year  or 23 percent tax filers  according NPR analysis figures

losses  Buffalo Bills making change quarterback  Bills head coach Sean McDermott announced Wednesday Nathan Peterman start Sunday s game Los Angeles Chargers   Bills HC Sean McDermott says QB Nathan Peterman start Sunday    Joe Buscaglia  JoeBuscaglia  November 15  2017 Peterman played late last Sunday s blowout loss New Orleans Saints  McDermott said loss Tyrod Taylor still starter going forward  Today  told media made decision switch quarterback Tuesday  READ MORE  Bills  Tyrod Taylor benched   I don t agree decision  McDermott says decision becoming better team   Bills HC Sean McDermott  Tyrod made improvements  He s made significant contribution team  I remain confident moving forward    Joe Buscaglia  JoeBuscaglia  November 15  2017  Bills HC Sean McDermott  As continue grow move direction I want us go  going difficult decisions    Joe Buscaglia  JoeBuscaglia  November 15  2017 McDermott said Sunday Saints loss  Monday  Taylor starter  He said made decision change quarterbacks Tuesday  informed entire team choice Wednesday morning  When asked would permanent move  one time start  McDermott replied   We ll see  Joe B s Take Well  I certainly wasn t expecting kick things Wednesday morning  Considering standings  still holding one two Wild Card positions AFC first 10 weeks  genuine surprise Bills team played well first seven games season  What transpired last two weeks  though  seemed enough Bills pull trigger move Taylor bench second time career Bills  And admittedly  I wrong  I didn t think Bills would make move long playoff breath  That s usual logic within NFL  Bills defied usual logic  respect  The Bills desperate offense something try counter Saints Sunday  got next nothing Taylor rarely took chances field   opted check large margin second half  When Peterman came in  I expecting prevent defense run Saints game well garbage time  However  Saints zone coverage  certainly wasn t soft zone Peterman something haven t seen much Taylor  He threw ball anticipation multiple times  game 11 plays  Peterman attacked short intermediate areas field  clearly best offense looked since first series game   without running game  Now  also consider threw pair really errant passes Saints didn t full starting defense game  Even still  reviewing game All 22 Tuesday  hard come away game least tad impressed rookie bench two and a half months  However  let s kid ourselves  timing shocking  McDermott seemed hellbent winning year gave real indication appearances media Sunday Monday even consideration  Taylor popular entity within locker room  well  Players like LeSean McCoy incredibly vocal support Taylor  even going lengths saying doesn t know Taylor doesn t get credit things field  This decision likely unpopular one players grown deeply respect appreciate everything Taylor puts job  Taylor seemed slightly progress areas Bills desired to  He settled pocket much past years  earlier season  drove ball field highlight reel throws  However  always one lingering question  Did actually fit offense offensive coordinator Rick Dennison wanted run  Early year even preseason  clear Taylor wasn t comfortable certain parts offense  Most notably  Taylor line center perform either three five step drop  It didn t come naturally Taylor  starter  evolved mostly shotgun based scheme  As uncovered Matthew Fairburn NYUpstate com  Bills started tinkering blocking schemes near middle year try generate offensively  would think byproduct able operate center without short drops keep defense honest enough  If I guess  despite Sean McDermott saying decision  I would tend believe Peterman s natural fit Dennison offense one offensive coordinator pushed head coach  Now  question is  see  We ll likely see lot anticipatory throws rookie  welcomed sight Bills fans wanting Taylor past two and a half seasons  What also means we ll see much offense shown preseason earlier season  I d anticipate see less shotgun  three five step drops  lot play action help take pressure running game  We re also going see lot errant throws Peterman saw Taylor  turn  we re going see Bills likely turn ball bit we ve grown accustomed past seasons  Peterman take chances field Taylor  certainly isn t afraid tight window throw  His deep accuracy something I d like see improve  helm  Dennison wants shot taken  taken   we re bound see it  Let s also forget GM Brandon Beane said repeatedly offseason number one belief trait quarterback able possess  good pocket passer  And Taylor certainly improved past years  still shown much hesitation pocket rookie Peterman better fit style offense  What also signals even though Bills playoff race  still first year trying do  rebuild roster highest level   short term gains  In respect  I like boldness move  despite timing little peculiar  I ve impressed McDermott Beane s ability turn roster still remaining competitive year  falls line bold moves they ve made since days training camp started  They long haul  it s abundantly clear don t believe Taylor part plan  While may come situation Peterman struggles need go back Taylor stretch season  don t fooled  unless something drastic occurs end season  Taylor isn t plans Bills moving forward  You simply can t make move point season  put stuffing back toy pass brand new  They knew magnitude decision signals moving forward important position sports  chose go it  There chance season Taylor could work way plans showing signs progress pocket  regression certain key points season likely sealed fate  I think Taylor solid quarterback helped stay games turning ball over  he s likely find least competition starting job elsewhere 2018  It s clear Bills don t value enough start crucial game Week 11  turn  makes notion keeping  18 million 2018 bit longshot  However  Taylor s ceiling  Was going lead team Super Bowl  Probably not  Was good enough get team playoffs  Most likely  yes  But it s clear McDermott s statements Wednesday goal bigger playoffs  want win Super Bowl Buffalo  I like bold moves  I like going fourth down  I like going two point conversion often not  I would hypocrite I said I didn t like going limb like Bills  Too often  we ve seen Bills try enough save jobs  stay competitive  go limb fear unknown  That longer case  They extended look see Peterman guy year future  long holds job  he s going two best teams AFC three separate times  Kansas City  New England  really good defense Los Angeles Chargers  Do Bills quarterback future Nathan Peterman  We don t know  Bills find   ample evidence   go important offseason McDermott Beane era try reshape roster sustained success  And I  one  can t wait see unfold  Twitter   JoeBuscaglia,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
