he s already hauled Capitol Hill testify Senate committee  When President Trump gets back Washington Tuesday night  following lengthy trip Asia  one first things asked eldest son  soup right throat time  On Monday  Julia Ioffe  The Atlantic   revealed that  final weeks last year s campaign  Trump  Jr  corresponded via direct messages Twitter WikiLeaks  busy posting e mails hacked personal account John Podesta  Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman  According Ioffe s article   Trump  Jr  also sent e mail informing people campaign including Steve Bannon  Kellyanne Conway  Jared Kushner about contact  Evidently  Donald Trump wasn t included e mail chain  implicated indirectly chain events  Shortly Ioffe s piece appeared  Wall Street Journal s Byron Tau pointed October 12  2016  fifteen minutes WikiLeaks sent Trump  Jr  message suggesting father tweet link WikiLeaks search tool  Trump tweeted   Very little pick up dishonest media incredible information provided WikiLeaks  So dishonest  Rigged system  It noted currently proof Trump  Jr  informed father contacts WikiLeaks  But timing certainly suggestive   I suppose could say mere coincidence Trump tweeted WikiLeaks 15 minutes organization asked eldest son that  CNN s Chris Cillizza noted Tuesday   But  would one hell coincidence given timing tweets fact know       Don Jr  let senior staff campaign know WikiLeaks made contact back September 21  Those fifteen minutes aren t troublesome timing issue Trump Trump  Jr  On October 7th  five days earlier  Department Homeland Security Office National Intelligence

certainly crime  Earlier month  Wall Street Journal reported Department Justice considering criminal charges least six Russians believes involved hacking Democratic National Committee  To sure  none

October  WikiLeaks sending Trump  Jr  direct messages  Fox News interviewer asked Mike Pence  Trump s Vice Presidential candidate  whether campaign  in cahoots  WikiLeaks  He replied   Nothing could truth  On Monday night  Atlantic s story appeared  spokeswoman Pence said  never aware anyone associated campaign contact WikiLeaks  He first learned news published report earlier  That pretty humiliating admission Vice President make  appears that  earlier statements  either lying taken naf  As Tuesday afternoon  President hadn t commented publicly latest Trump  Jr  firestorm  tweet say

Campaign Fair Sentencing Youth  Eric Holder grabbed Blackberry search results Virginia elections  As former Attorney General scrolled backward long e mail thread  quickly learned stunning night Democrats  He also understood that  triumph  might little harder keep party focussed gerrymandering   The system didn t become fair result happened last night  Holder told next day   The system appears fair spite reality Democratic candidates faced  The job I make sure people don t become complacent  Holder spent past year tackling hopeless task making redistricting sexy  He leads National Democratic Redistricting Committee  charge nothing less saving Party s prospects next decade  Big donors need convinced state legislative races matter much Presidency  congressional leaders  desperate retake House 2018  need recognize long term down ballot success crucial unlocking future majorities  These easy arguments pursue politicians narrowly focussed next election  It s even harder believe electoral wave one like last Tuesday s rather sacrifice  compromise  planning  save them   Their professional lives going little less certain  Holder said   But Democrats can t go another decade like decade now  In another decade  Republicans could solidify way that  well  you d talking structural changes I m sure could overcome even get 2031  Democrats slumbered redistricting 2010  they re awake now  Their snooze  however  coincided audacious Republican strategy called REDMAP   short Redistricting Majority Project  Republicans targeted control state legislatures  eye toward dominating redistricting state legislatures U S  House seats  They fought especially hard battleground states likely gain lose member Congress decennial post census reapportionment  In 2008  Democrats held nearly sixty per cent state legislative chambers  Now Republicans control almost seventy per cent  Democrats flipped congressional seat blue decade ostensible swing states North Carolina  Michigan  Ohio  Pennsylvania  Wisconsin  Those states currently sending total forty eight Republicans twenty Democrats D C  During Obama era  Democrats also bled nearly thousand state legislative seats nationwide  They hold fewer forty per cent lower house seats four five crucial purplish states  The exception Michigan  Democrats gained aggregate state House votes Republicans last three statewide cycles  can t break past forty two per cent seats  These state legislative gerrymanders proven durable Democrats need elect governors simply seat table new maps drawn 2021  Virginia provided first dry run  full slate crucial governors  races next year Michigan  Pennsylvania  Wisconsin  Ohio  Florida  In speeches multimillionaire donors countless e mails seeking little five dollars grassroots  Holder contended Democrats needed elect Ralph Northam governor Virginia  Republican Ed Gillespie  Party could veto extreme partisan maps drawn G O P  legislature 2020 census  The N D R C  poured  1 2 million Northam s coffers  biggest investment far  Since Gillespie longtime Washington lobbyist designed G O P s 2010 redistricting strategy  Northam s victory much satisfying  But gerrymandered House Delegates controlled 66 34 Republicans beginning night suddenly appeared play  Democrats gained least fifteen seats  If Republicans hang leads three districts awaiting recounts  eke 51 49 majority   To kind swing gerrymandered map breathtaking  Holder said  The G O P  gerrymander would make difference  Northam carried Virginia nine percentage points  Democratic House Delegates candidates statewide also outpolled Republicans nine points in words  required nearly double digit Democratic win approach parity   It s wave election get fifty fifty  Holder said   We can t lose sight       With fair maps  fair lines  would expected Democrats would ve done far better did  For reasons more  Holder wants Democrats guard overconfidence  As watched Democratic gains Virginia s House Delegates last week  however  also wondered dramatic electoral upset might affect Supreme Court Justices weighing Gill v  Whitford  crucial Wisconsin case could lead first ever constitutional standard rein partisan gerrymandering  That case centered around state assembly districts Republicans drew 2011  Those lines proved friendly Republicans that  2012  Democratic assembly candidates earned hundred seventy four thousand votes Republicans  G O P  sixty ninety nine seats  In oral arguments last month  conservative Justices suggested need Court involve partisan gerrymandering  voters always capable toppling even extreme lines ballot box  Paul Smith  representing Wisconsin voters protesting maps  vehemently disagreed  He told Court  this map never going flip over  The evidence unequivocal Democrats would earthquake unprecedented proportions even chance get fifty votes ninety nine  Chief Justice John Roberts  however  reminded Smith lawyer made similar argument Court decade earlier  partisan gerrymandering last appeared Justices  A days later  Democrats flipped Pennsylvania   They every single race  Roberts said   Predicting basis statistics us hazardous enterprise  Holder recognized Virginia results might persuade conservatives Court and newly hopeful Democrats that wave elections beat back gerrymanders   My hope would would level sophistication look happened Virginia understand really occurred  put context  Holder said  A big win provided new  unwelcome  challenges   There s another layer job  Holder said   Democrats need understand happened spite gerrymandered

industry  like entertainment media industries  recently forced acknowledge pervasive problem issues  As women industries and others have come forward accounts discrimination  harassment  even sexual assault context workplaces  comparisons Wall Street become increasingly relevant  The financial industry nineteen eighties nineties many great fortunes last generation made and also setting dramatic gender discrimination lawsuits corporate America ever seen  A handful banks ended paying millions dollars fines legal settlements cases whose salacious details made international headlines  For wondering current wave accusations resignations might translate lasting change improvements professional women  Wall Street s history instructive  In nineteen nineties  many women started seeking careers banks brokerage firms  looking take places professionals breadwinners alongside men  encountered barriers ranging harassment assault pay discrimination unequal access opportunities  Women harder time gaining entry prestigious training programs  given less time study mandatory tests male colleagues were  According  Tales Boom Boom Room  female  control administrators  Smith Barney

women before   Something I ve found stories years gets headlines  revert back norm  Antilla said  She added powerful response allegations Harvey Weinstein   international attention attracted  gave hope maybe time would different  But Wall Street precedent isn t encouraging  When comes equal pay  example  Antilla pointed recent study Institute Women s Policy Research gender pay gap across

employers  added bonus keeping disputes eye press   I think arbitration reason Wall Street moved on  sometimes even goes backwards  they ve institutionalized ability keep problem public view  Antilla said   When years years that  people start feel entitled whatever want  act impunity  Other industries such Silicon Valley have followed Wall Street s example  increasingly insisting arbitration

Reckoning,In mid nineteen eighties  aspiring stockbroker named Lori Hurwitz got job Garden City  Long Island  office Shearson Lehman Brothers  one largest brokerage firms Wall Street  Hurwitz twenty three  spent days apprentice pair experienced male brokers  less desirable work  cold calling several hundred strangers day trying pitch opening accounts firm  The brokerage business exciting  growing profession a career future  The problem  Hurwitz s perspective  environment utterly hostile women  The branch manager open fact paid women office significantly less men  and  detailed Susan Antilla s   Tales Boom Boom Room  The Landmark Legal Battles That Exposed Wall Street s Shocking Culture Sexual Harassment   definitive book era  oppressive atmosphere sexual banter crude jokes  In office s basement infamous  Boom Boom Room  itself  liquor soaked happy hour parties hosted  When Hurwitz finally complained manager sex jokes lack opportunity  things got even worse  Eventually  told that  couldn t get along guys  seek another career  After fourteen months job  Hurwitz quit  In week s issue The New Yorker   I wrote article gender imbalance sexual harassment Silicon Valley   The tech industry  like entertainment media industries  recently forced acknowledge pervasive problem issues  As women industries and others have come forward accounts discrimination  harassment  even sexual assault context workplaces  comparisons Wall Street become increasingly relevant  The financial industry nineteen eighties nineties many great fortunes last generation made and also setting dramatic gender discrimination lawsuits corporate America ever seen  A handful banks ended paying millions dollars fines legal settlements cases whose salacious details made international headlines  For wondering current wave accusations resignations might translate lasting change improvements professional women  Wall Street s history instructive  In nineteen nineties  many women started seeking careers banks brokerage firms  looking take places professionals breadwinners alongside men  encountered barriers ranging harassment assault pay discrimination unequal access opportunities  Women harder time gaining entry prestigious training programs  given less time study mandatory tests male colleagues were  According  Tales Boom Boom Room  female  control administrators  Smith Barney median pay  50 405  males made  67 614  In 1996  three women  Pamela Martens  Judith Mione  Roberta O Brien Thomann  filed class action lawsuit Smith Barney  which merged Shearson  charging company gender discrimination  Smith Barney eventually paid hundred fifty million dollars arbitration awards settlements resolve case  On surface  appeared financial industry learned lessons lawsuit others like it  Large banks brokerage firms implemented harassment training compliance measures  hired experienced professionals run human resources departments  But  I recently asked Susan Antilla  reporting fellow Investigative Fund Nation Institute  believed Wall Street truly reformed itself  said   Pretty much  no  Antilla said similarities what s happening today older Wall Street cases  Then  now  said  stories seemed come waves  She recalled sexual harassment case wrote 1995  small brokerage called Olde Discount Corp  prompted Pam Martens  one lead Smith Barney plaintiffs  hire lawyers case  A year Martens s case garnered public attention  group women banded together sued Merrill Lynch   It dominoes  Antilla told me  However  said  financial industry  long run  become much welcoming women before   Something I ve found stories years gets headlines  revert back norm  Antilla said  She added powerful response allegations Harvey Weinstein   international attention attracted  gave hope maybe time would different  But Wall Street precedent isn t encouraging  When comes equal pay  example  Antilla pointed recent study Institute Women s Policy Research gender pay gap across different industries  listed financial occupations among worst  job personal financial adviser  example  shown largest gap  women earning 55 6 per cent men did  And  Antilla said   terrible pay harassment go hand hand   O K  they ve taken Playboy centerfold cubicle  Antilla said   There things don t anymore  You would never see  big brokerage firm  saw Smith Barney  would send stripper someone s birthday  But it s women aren t harassed  She also noted financial firms pioneers using arbitration  rather courts  settle workplace cases  Private arbitration generally viewed favorable employers  added bonus keeping disputes eye press   I think arbitration reason Wall Street moved on  sometimes even goes backwards  they ve institutionalized ability keep problem public view  Antilla said   When years years that  people start feel entitled whatever want  act impunity  Other industries such Silicon Valley have followed Wall Street s example  increasingly insisting arbitration agreements employees  Still  Antilla told heartened bravery seen lately among women coming forward lodge harassment charges high profile men  public outrage directed toward alleged harassers  One biggest differences she s noticed nineteen nineties lawsuits cases filed today  Antilla said  technology providing tools make easier women collect evidence  turn makes harder companies ignore complaints might past  Several cases including Gretchen Carlson  filed sexual harassment charges former Fox News chief Roger Ailes  case reportedly settled twenty million dollars have involved women made audio recordings alleged harassers   For years  impossible  said  said  Antilla said   When I talk employment lawyers now  tell people regularly come offices they ve got something phones   She added people looking record alleged harassment  anything else  need insure legal state make recordings without permission  When I asked Antilla anything else felt women facing workplace discrimination

blessing scams appeared Chinese media around turn century  In 2002  eight hundred incidents Hong Kong  leading police establish dedicated task force  Investigators determined suspects middle aged women  working crews three four  almost came southern coastal provinces  whose proximity wealth Hong Kong Taiwan creates tempting opportunities criminals  The scammers travelled first Taiwan cities across Asia  Chinese communities United States  Canada  Australia  In summer 2012  San Francisco  fifty incidents  netted estimated  1 5 million cash goods  Nine people since stood trial  received prison sentences four years  The prosecution said defendants professionals conning elderly Chinese women around globe  The countries stamped passports included Indonesia  Japan  Malaysia  Brunei  Cambodia  In New York currently  around ten reported cases year  Kevin Hui  detective New York Police Department s organized crime unit worked Wang s case  told that  spike number cases 2012  colleagues contacted police Hong Kong effort better understand phenomenon  In 2014  tracking scammers intensively  N Y P D  lodged sealed indictments number suspects  but  arrests could made  disappeared  presumably escaping China  In early 2016  police managed arrest three scammers   took felony pleas served prison time  Hui said department process following two gangs work New York  Policing blessing scams made harder fact victims frequently scared humiliated report crime  Earlier year  I spoke late Eddie Chiu  Hong Kong native many years headed Lin Sing Association  one oldest Chinatown community organizations  often advised elderly victims reluctant involve authorities  Some feared would expose irregularities immigration tax status   They also afraid losing face  said   They saving money burial arrangements give grandchildren  sometimes children don t even know it  The victims worried children would berate credulous kept money secret first place   They fearful embarrassed  said   The scammers know it  exploit it  In 2014  vulnerability communities led Kenneth P  Thompson  Brooklyn s District Attorney time  set Immigrant Fraud Unit  Its work since expanded successor  Eric Gonzalez   One third population Brooklyn immigrants  Chinese community fastest growing one  Gonzalez told one afternoon office  Gonzalez  second generation Puerto Rican  spoke

similar incidents across city  closed eight suspects  One day  Hui  driving Chinatown duty  saw group scammers action  He called backup  another officer filmed everything made arrests  Officers caught four eight people they d tracking  As police prosecutors reviewed evidence  became clear one scammers involved number incidents  It woman introduced Wang Liu  Her real name Su Xuekun  At District

Flushing  Queens  netted four hundred thousand dollars  Ng told me   We video footage act  lineup identification  Su indicted four counts grand larceny  relating two separate incidents  Because one offense  prosecutors able indict hate crime statute seek stiffer sentence  It rare someone prosecuted hate crime people ethnicity  Interiano said believed case warranted it   The term  hate crime  poorly worded  said  suggested  bias crime  better represented intent statute   If look statute itself  word  hate  actually omitted  The fact is  victims shared several characteristics  female  older  Chinese  All one cases Immigrant Fraud Unit handled involved perpetrators share ethnic background victims  Ng said   It s natural  whether it s West Indian Latino East Asian community  He laughed recalled  child  seeing parents get swindled Chinese car salesman   You speak language  feel like instant understanding bond  Scammers prey upon that  Interiano Ng  like police  think scammers part well organized crime ring  Different crews used stories  and  whereas Chinese immigrants depend family connections establish themselves  suspects arrived knowing one  problem instantly finding accommodations employment  Interiano said didn t consider victims unusually gullible  Rather  scam perfectly devised take advantage people sources information  The initial conversation victim way harvesting personal information  Using cell phone  first two scammers could third listen in  could send texts pertinent points  The third scammer would seem supernatural insight victim s life  making

Still  I wondered Su s fabrications might contain least fragments truth  Shen Anqi  legal scholar Teesside University  U K  made study female Chinese criminals  told upbringing Su described typical

China s one child policy never penetrated rural hinterland  With poor education  left unqualified anything beyond manual labor  confronted China s rapid social change  rising inequality  burgeoning

Su tend prey people like themselves   They know it s like desperate fervently want something quick fix  like blessing  said   It s desperation chasing desperation  It occurred that  Su told Wang they

Su told almost relieved caught   I don t lie anymore  The pressure s off  And  indigent Chinese immigrant  facilities Rikers didn t seem hardship   We live fifty women room  said   There s time space

Wang told wait opening package echoed forty nine days spirits recently dead must wait allocated place afterlife a belief entered Chinese tradition  India  fourth century B C  The chant told recite plausibly Buddhist  granddaughter s gesture blessing  arms raised heavenward  evoked Daoist ritual  When I asked Wang symbols  vague meaning origins   The white tiger ill omen everyone knows this  said  The exact significance symbols less clear fact carried significance  Jonathan H  X  Lee  associate professor Asian American Studies San Francisco State University  told common among contemporary Chinese   It s ritual symbol passed down  said   They carry import  even historical origins lost  He said due  part  syncretism Chinese belief the way indigenous religion prehistoric China gradually

ancestor worship part everyday life  ancestors receive offerings food incense would become hungry irritated netherworld   Gods  ghosts  ancestors connected world view  Lee told me   Gods exceptional historical human beings ancestors become deified  Hungry ghosts ancestors properly venerated   Many Chinese communities annually celebrate Hungry Ghost Festival  order feed placate disruptive spirits  In China  ghosts particularly integrated social administrative life  By early twelfth century  Daoist exorcism rites used judicial language interrogate sentence troublesome ghosts  The founder Ming

Ultimately  seems  faith itself  rather specific cosmology  made people susceptible fraud  I spoke Barend Ter Haar  scholar Chinese religion Oxford University  made point  although  Western

depths  waves glow blue  Some phenomena ocean witnessed dark  1  Bioluminescence makes sea shimmer You may seen pictures  It s night time impossibly exotic location  Waves breaking beach  The water sparkling electric blue lights  The internet loves image magical looking bioluminescent bay  You may also seen travel bloggers bemoaning real event quite living hype  Even latter true  bioluminescence  in case usually caused planktonic organisms called dinoflagellates  pretty amazing natural phenomenon  Dinoflagellates emit blue light disturbed  seen sparkling wave crests  around boats hand paddle runs them  These tiny creatures common source bioluminescence ocean s surface  So called bioluminescent bays Puerto Rico Jamaica among best known places witness glow  However  ephemeral phenomenon found throughout ocean dense gatherings dinoflagellates  Sometimes dinoflagellates  population increases rapidly causing blooms  day coloured less attractive red brown  sometimes known red tides  And some  all  red tides poisonous  Even stranger rarer bioluminescent bays  milky seas  continually glowing water stretches far eye see  Milky seas seen hundred times since 1915  mainly concentrated around north western Indian Ocean near Java  Indonesia  They caused dinoflagellates  thought result  bioluminescent bacteria accumulated large numbers near surface  explains Dr Matt Davis  Assistant Professor Biology  St  Cloud State University US  specialises bioluminescence  Reports sailors centuries described milky seas nocturnal whitish glow like field snow  scientists little chance investigate phenomenon first hand  In 2005  researchers analysing archived satellite images found milky seas could seen space one satellite captured images huge area ocean displayed strange glow three consecutive nights decade earlier  2  Animals glow dark Bioluminescence  emission visible light organism result natural chemical reaction  common among marine life fishes  squid molluscs  In deep sea

theorised lunar illumination combined emerging sunlight may decrease stealth ability sharks advantage switched sharks seals night turned day  And seals may rely another celestial feature navigate   stars  Captive harbour seals  Phoca vitulina  able locate single lodestar steer it  researchers shown  During test using simulated night sky  seals swam towards brightest star could orientate stars

foraging grounds dawn dusk see stars landmarks coast  5  Strange animals come surface every night Under cover darkness rarely seen creatures migrate ocean s surface feed  The Humboldt squid  also

months  The trains  powered hand loaded coal furnaces  moved slowly  And importantly  hobbled intermittent battles  fuel shortages  harsh winter weather general chaos war  neither White Forces Bolsheviks could advance quickly  The chase  like schlepp obstacles  progressed slow motion  A months race  halfway across Siberia  treasure train arrived hands general Alexander Kolchak  White Forces  newly minted commander in chief  With Trotsky s troops tail  Kolchak directed train east  far away enemy possible  He brought train Irkutsk  trading city near Lake Baikal  And that s exactly train stopping next  We arrived Irkutsk dead night  city empty even taxi drivers gone  With vague sense hotel was  Dennis I dragged luggage darkened streets  avoiding stray dogs made home overgrown bushes  Streetlights didn t seem work part town  spent hour walking circles moon light  We could barely believe luck finally discovered hotel behind patch tall trees  It Irkutsk Czech battalions  hired Russia

collateral worked  The Bolsheviks took gold  let Czechs begin journey promptly shot Kolchak  next 70 years portrayed Soviet history books enemy people thus deserving death firing squad  But Dennis I wandered along Irkutsk s broad streets next day  I made surprising discovery  In one city squares I found recently erected monument Kolchak  honouring important political figure  Russian historians clearly rewritten chapter revolutionary chronicle  monument s brass plaque explained fought ideals died protecting empire s treasure  Kolchak s story culminated Irkutsk  treasure s journey didn t  The Bolsheviks loaded gold onto new train sent back Kazan  According Volkov  treasure returned entirety  But historians insist numbers don t add up  easily 200 tons  more  Local lore sides latter

exploration stop  flattened patch land top rocky cliff overlooking Lake Baikal  soft spoken blonde guide Tatiana issued warning   Be careful going down  slope steep  We passed village babushkas selling bread smoked omul  Baikal fish  headed meandering path overgrown stinging nettles  The crumbly soil didn t hold well underfoot  making us grab tree branches rocks balance  While daredevils went skinny dipping Baikal s frigid water  barely reaches 10C  I sat mound stared slope sheer I could longer see train  Yes  carriages lost footing would inevitably tumble lake  Back accidents happened time Tatiana sat next I couldn t help ask   So famous gold train fell off  She gave wide smile   That depends ask  said   People Moscow don t believe story   think made up  But local elders  heard parents  know something happened  And think it  back accidents happened time  The old trains wobbly unbalanced  Her words made wonder like ride train 100 years ago  I climbed back uphill  I headed straight train crew  For small tip  crew let Dennis ride old locomotive  next sizzling  hand loaded coal furnace   Looking gold  huh  one crewmen asked train pulled deafening whistle   My friend s father diving pro could stay underwater five minutes  He dove gold every summer found none  Baikal keeps secrets  know   So gold really there  bottom  I asked  Baikal keeps secrets  know The crewman jumped in   When research submersible Mir Baikal dives 2009  team found train wrecks 700m deep  They saw small objects glistening sediment crevice  couldn t get it  couldn t grab bring surface  If wasn t gold bars it  I m asking you  The train picked speed rattle huge metal wheels became overwhelming  For next hour  thrown around small cabin smacked tree branches trying look window  But I got see incredibly close tracks precarious edge  spine tingling feeling hanging nothingness made dizzy  That evening  I sat outdoor terrace hotel rustic resort town Listvyanka near Baikal s southern

 Her son  gangly man 20s  listened quietly  getting upset I dared question legend   You can t go what s written book  raved   You listen people  And dawned me  In Russia  lived decades propaganda  printed word changes one regime next  capricious like Baikal s weather  The Kolchak monument I saw Irkutsk perfect example that  But information published books periodicals may change tide  people  see  hear pass remember  act historians  Even add new details drama then  memories may indeed hold truth heap pages fresh press  We want legend live on  it s beautiful die Silenced sudden revelation  I didn t respond lady s fervent speech  decided I ignoring walked away indignant snort   This delicate subject family  son explained   My mother told us grandfather helped soldiers bury gold woods  went back couldn t find spot  He spent every summer searching it  one year didn t come back  He disappeared   I m sorry  I apologised   I didn t mean offend mother  I m curious lost gold really exists

easy question United States yet answer correctly  And it s reason I worried future country  Story Continued Below That last statement feel cliche given current environment  partisans spin routine conflicts existential threats describe every election final verdict nation s fate  But something different happening politics today  There seems subtle concerted effort paint black citizens criticize President Donald Trump United States un American  Black people dare suggest country living professed ideals offhandedly deemed unpatriotic ungrateful blessing born  shining city upon hill  If critiques met crude suggestion buy one way ticket  back  Africa  we re accused rent seeking laziness victimization  It s though political strategist discovered best way counter claims leaders indifferent pervasive racial inequalities imply accusers hate nation troops  After all  American parade horribles  unpatriotic ingrates worse racist could ever because  well  least racists love America  Why think want badly themselves  There lack incidents create cause concern  When black NFL players kneeled national anthem protest racial injustice  president called  sons bitches  disrespecting nation  flag veterans  He invited professional hockey champion Pittsburgh Penguins White House called all white assembly mostly non American players  incredible patriots  As black man Northern Virginia  I well aware state s gubernatorial race seen bellwether white identity politics electoral expediency racial animus  For weeks  bombarded Republican nominee Ed Gillespie s campaign ads dog whistled soundtracks preservation Confederate statues taking stands Election Day tower lot heathens who d dare take knee national anthem  So view Democrat Ralph Northam s win repudiation politics racial resentment  I remain worried questioning black people s allegiance country still seen viable political strategy  When Rep  Frederica Wilson  black congresswoman Florida  chastised president making insensitive comments Myeshia Johnson  widow U S  Army Sgt  La David Johnson killed Niger  White House chief staff John Kelly called  empty barrel  others labeled national disgrace  The White House contrasted Kelly Wilson  saying  highly inappropriate  question four star general  thank God patriots like Gen  Kelly  The list goes on  Black Lives Matter characterized  un American  Trump emissary former New York Mayor Rudy Guiliani  During Attorney General Jeff Sessions  confirmation hearing  witnesses testified he d called NAACP un American  Trump likened majority black inner cities violent foreign countries  Former Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka recently made dysphemistic suggestion major issue facing black America systemic racism  segregated communities socioeconomic disparities   black African gun crime black Africans  conveniently leaving  American  And  course  things compare Trump s insistence nation s first black president was  fact  American all  And quite pleased Arizona s embattled former Sheriff Joe Arpaio volunteered look Barack Obama s birth certificate  Trump recently pardoned Arpaio criminal contempt conviction racial profiling case  calling  great American patriot  In previous life military officer  job preoccupied threats America s well being  And precisely reason current political rhetoric around race patriotism feels especially acute inappropriate  This tactic the attempt disentangle blackness patriotism America is extremely dangerous  It born ugliest parts history presents dire threat political stability  Let us never forget thing ever broken Union half question I began with  Should thing black American  We went war question  More 600 000 countrymen died question  A president assassinated question  The notion black American controversial Founding Fathers avoided altogether  Citizens turned guns other  Racist state regimes violently suppressed constitutional rights  And Army s elite 101st Airborne Division deployed nine black teenagers could go high school Little Rock  Arkansas  So patriotism black Americans questioned even it s done simply reframe debate favorable terms avoid uncomfortable conversations race the nation s worst impulses resurface  It fosters perception black people United States less American white neighbors  Being seen less American means one less claim citizenship  civil protections equal opportunity  It s creates voting laws complicate voting process black communities instead making easier  It s rationale aggressive policing minority communities  It s core view black achievement United States isn t product intellect hard work  white magnanimity  And veteran  I take deep offense attempt separate blackness America patriotism  Black people United States fought every war since nation s inception even could access citizenship  Black troops left families  took arms foreign shores  risked lives idea  promise  They fought Revolutionary War American independence  War 1812 American self determination Spanish American War 1898 American expansion all hopes service would compel nation recognize rights full citizenship  What higher form American patriotism fighting inalienable rights life  liberty pursuit happiness can t access it  That Spirit  76 led nation s creation  And  necessity  spirit still much alive well black America yet realize fullness American promise  These signs lesser Americans  signature superlative citizens  And yet  despite fighting unrealized freedoms  scores black veterans returning home conflict denied access veterans benefits rights full American citizenship  Jehu Grant enslaved man Rhode Island fought Continental Army  But Congress passed Pension Act 1832  Grant s annuity denied America determined slaves couldn t soldiers  When black World War II vets returned home  nearly denied access GI Bill  helped white veterans buy homes get education helped create atrocious racial wealth gap today  This happens black people even willing put lives line aren t seen real Americans  This this inability allow black Americans fully black fully American is national weakness  And enemies know it  The recent revelations Russia took fake ads Facebook used fake Twitter accounts exacerbate racial tensions United States come surprise  The fact countries long sought exploit racial discrimination order weaken United States shocking  Racism fault line  Achilles  heel  So tactic labeling black citizens critical government leaders un American dangerous ground  It playing fire that s consumed us past one domestic threat dismantle us again  I worried country  Not myopic lazy politicians decide play people s fears prejudices win elections  Not white nationalists march across university campuses discount Tiki torches  Not polarized politics side sees evil destructive  I worried country yet decided whether black American paradox fellow citizen  We cannot both  history proved country cannot survive former  Either United States

what Bill Clinton  stuff is  wrote   it s also true Democrats center left overdue real reckoning allegations him  Story Continued Below It glimpsed passing New York Times editorial  Ground Zero conventional liberalism   Remember former President Bill Clinton  whose popularity endures despite long string allegations sexual misconduct and  one case  rape all denied  said  David Remnick  editor New Yorker  coastal elitism badge honor  acknowledged elephant room way   That many women summoned courage make public allegations Weinstein  Bill Cosby  Roger Ailes  Bill O Reilly or many come reconsider claims made Bill Clinton represents cultural passage  And full throated  unvarnished form  appeared piece Monday The Atlantic redoubtable Caitlin Flanagan  unbound specific ideology  In piece titled   Bill Clinton The Reckoning  Flanagan pointed Monica Lewinsky story  Gennifer Flowers  story consensual behavior  darker series stories far back 1978   It pattern behavior  included

Maybe way Right seized stories  made part much broader  far less credible series accusations  The late Rev  Jerry Falwell spent years peddling  the Clinton Chronicles  series videos charged Clintons

taught recognize  a friend saw alleged incident saw bruised lip torn clothes  This allegation that Clinton take  no  answer has always unsettled even former president s strongest admirers   I remember asking Clinton aide CNN many years ago struck fact pushback  denial  But wake Weinstein taught us  gaps Broaddrick s story seem explicable  Of course didn t file complaint  chief law enforcement officer state  Of course denied story one point  interest becoming public figure  At height Lewinsky impeachment melodrama  Clinton s defenders always argued president s behavior private matter  To day  find references Clinton s  dalliances   peccadilloes  It also true three cases  grounds doubt  Broaddrick changed story  Jones could accurately describe presidential package  Willey also accused

conspiracy minded extremists  But there s another  broad question progressives Democrats need confront  one reaches beyond Clinton  And it s issue triggered response Right Trump s campaign   to lesser extent former Judge Roy Moore  Are going let partisan politics warp capacity clear moral judgment  All 2016  figures Right debated Trump  His character  temperament  history  knowledge  or lack

earlier assurances innocence Lewinsky affair false  His Health Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala upbraided conduct  noted professor university ran  would bounced conduct  To Clinton replied  according Washington Post   that logic prevailed 1960  Richard M  Nixon would elected president instead John F  Kennedy  This is  may recognize  mirror image argument Trump s supporters made skeptics

Well  might want shelve one  We can t let problems personal conduct override enormous political stakes  But Clinton s reply Shalala raises one final  highly unsettling question  Given today s terrain

Congress launched new job creation program  It done tax code  offering employers  2 100 credit new hire  Over past 40 years  program cost tens billions dollars reformed dozens times  Today  it s small targeted  Employers receive subsidy hiring specific individuals  including food stamp recipients  disabled veterans and  2015  long term unemployed  Helping disadvantaged Americans find work kind thing Democrats Republicans agree on  even today s politically charged atmosphere  But part once in a generation tax overhaul  House Republicans want eliminate decades old program  If plan passes  employers stop receiving tax credit hiring disabled vets long term unemployed people a change experts believe would make harder people toughest situations find work   It would significant barrier us

important beneficiaries  The large number impacted groups already causing significant friction reform  it s likely beginning  Disability rights groups  like Autism Alliance Michigan  veterans  groups  including Veterans Foreign Wars American Legion  speaking removal WOTC   definitely incentivizes employers hire veterans  said Ariel DeJesus  assistant director American Legion  Housing groups state local governments fighting keep tax break supports development low income housing  Pro life groups already convinced House Republicans restore  3 8 billion tax break adoptive parents  repealed original bill  And calls likely grow louder numerous Senate GOP released tax plan  expected repeal limit many similar tax breaks  If sheer number interest groups might seem make ambitious tax reform impossible  there s simple reason  blame lies Congress  As 1977 law suggests  Congress decades using tax code stash subsidies could never get front door budget process  Thanks Democrats Republicans worried tagged spendthrifts  U S  tax code grown vast shadow budget  massive law stacked social programs  incentives economic growth  even special subsidies sports stadiums rum manufacturers  Since early 1990s  shadow spending   known budget wonks  tax expenditures  grown around  600 billion  1 2 trillion  adjusting inflation  Much growth come large  well known tax breaks  like exclusion employer sponsored health insurance mortgage interest deduction  would limited GOP bill  But sheer number tax expenditures also grown half period well  Since social programs buried tax code don t look like spending  politically popular make tax reform devilishly difficult  said Michael Strain  director economic studies American Enterprise Institute   It shows decrease tax bill rather increase amount government spending receive  said   But government spending  He added huge number tax expenditures   It s big comprehensive  How get arms around it  The result GOP s tax plan running afoul dozens groups including numerous small sympathetic constituencies benefit nearly  1 trillion worth breaks existing tax code  Morris described small cleaning company organization works relies Work

Republicans don t want expand it  And agree expand indirectly  The House GOP plan guided philosophy eliminating tax breaks cutting tax rates unleash economic growth  creating better economic outcomes everyone  They want reduce size tax code wiping away special interest giveaways limit even broadly popular tax breaks  like mortgage interest deduction  partially pay tax overhaul  But within broad framework  plenty inconsistencies  For instance  GOP plan eliminates New Markets Tax Credit  encourages businesses invest economically downtrodden areas  doesn t affect similar tax credit investing so called  empowerment zones  poor urban rural areas   Empowerment zones championed House Speaker Paul Ryan s mentor  former Rep  Jack Kemp  Originally  eliminated deduction adoption expenses but leaves untouched tax exclusion payments foster parents  Republican leaders argue that  broadly speaking  increased economic growth lower simpler taxes offset losers  Asked POLITICO Playbook event last week

provisions may use life  want tax code lowers rates get help every year life  On Thursday  facing pressure pro life groups  Brady introduced amendment retain adoption credit  Many experts believe people affected  amount additional growth make loss targeted tax breaks  It s near impossible economists tally costs veteran doesn t get job WOTC repealed fast food worker can t afford move better paying job  But individuals  costs real  even small piece  1 5 trillion tax cut would reshape U S  economy  This problem isn t unique GOP tax plan  All politicians talk cleaning tax code eliminating special interest loopholes  But plan wants significantly reduce number tax breaks inherently going face tough choices deductions credits serve real social purposes government doesn t ready replacements  There s way address programs  course  wouldn t help Republicans hold plan  1 5 trillion revenue losses  required budget  Instead simply wiping away tax breaks pay tax cuts  could converted government spending programs  funded year Congress annual budget process  For instance  Work Opportunity Tax Credit could become subsidized employment program  funded level tax credit  would cost around  400 million year  Congress could tax breaks  deduction adoption expenses subsidy workers move new job  Such plan could deficit neutral transparent  giving lawmakers chance fix flaws many programs built years  And would simplify tax code  But there s reason Congress unlikely take route anytime soon  It would give spending nowhere hide ,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Gerrymander 5K wasn t even 5K  It quarter mile long  It wasn t timed  There exact finish line  The beginning improvised   I ve never done before  shouted starter   so let s 1 2  3 go  okay  I knew going race wasn t meant competitive  It publicity gimmick  dreamed League Women Voters Asheville  North Carolina draw attention considered egregious example gerrymandering Republicans 2010 census  The race course  featured slightly sadistic series speed sucking hills tight turns  followed meandering dividing line North Carolina s 10th 11th districts  The route might challenging runners  perfect running campaign Republican  Story Continued Below A little history  Before 2011  11th district included Asheville  redoubt liberalness otherwise conservative western end state  This made district one competitive South  From 2007 2013  represented former NFL quarterback turned Blue Dog Democrat Heath Shuler  whose moderate  compromising approach way forward decidedly purple district  In 2011  Republicans control houses North Carolina legislature first time since Reconstruction  got added bonus control redistricting 2010 Census  They shifted political districts large small  North Carolina s congressional delegation turned 7 6 advantage Democrats today s 10 3 GOP majority  A big key Asheville  To dilute impact  Republican mapmakers grafted city onto 10th district  safely held Republican stalwart Patrick McHenry  shifted staunchly Republican counties foothills 11th   They cut McHenry s vote share  said Western Carolina University political science professor Chris Cooper   but enough give competitive elections  Overnight  11th  up for grabs congressional district North Carolina  became safely Republican  In 2012  Shuler deciding run  Republicans crowded primary field  relatively unknown real estate developer named Mark Meadows seat  He went co found chair Freedom Caucus  group shut government 2013 budget dispute battled moderate  establishment Republicans   If district hadn t redrawn  said Cooper   there s still chance John Boehner still Speaker House  Back race  The Gerrymander 5K  League Women Voters envisioned it  designed put gerrymandering microscope West Asheville  hipster enclave tattoo parlors biodiesel stations Thrillist described North Carolina s Brooklyn  The point race mock absurdity tiny contortions redistricters performed engineer obviously self serving electoral map  Looking course  easy see talking about  Much line sliced neighborhood along main roads  two spots swerved surgically grab two dozen homes pull 11th district   It doesn t really make sense  said Alana Pierce  president local League Women Voters  told I asked it  She perplexed one place line  plucks handful houses 10th district puts 11th   It doesn t look like one house strongly partisan Republican Democrat anything  said   It s six houses  It can t make difference  What I discovered  running slowest 5K time life  houses actually make difference  But wasn t difference organizers thought  To figure significance  I detective work  The answer I found explains something modern political mapmaking  It s always districts look like  include exclude  split counties  neighborhoods  It s whether think they re gerrymandered  It s whether lines hold court    As race  Gerrymander 5K unsatisfying  We run sidewalks  one poor woman nearly decapitated ran right guywire telephone pole  Since I knew I wasn t going official time  I tried pick clues I ran  course s frequent twists turns  brain power mostly used keep getting lost  So  hour I finished  I drove back neighborhood question a rectangle formed Louisiana Majestic avenues Brucemont Circle and knocked door every house block  six all  One brick veneered nicely kept  pair Japanese maples front yard  Another bungalow porch crowded enough gardening debris junk gave sort hoarder feng shui  Nobody home either one  At seemed vinyl sided duplex  young  skinny  bearded guy came door  He d moved couldn t tell much neighborhood  Same guy brand new white two story   I m new  said  saying still unpack  Next door  Aaron Nadler came edge chain link fence filled neighborhood  called Brucemont   I m sure you re going find anything story  said  I asked difference individual houses   Nothing  said   Nothing  Nadler rare conservative here  pointed thought conservatives lived mostly  figured  older  slightly shabbier homes owned longtime  older residents  He also idea 5K  meaning behind route   I thought chose I bunch Halloween stuff place  said  Walking streets  I picked lot subtle details Brucemont life  The smell charcoal  barking dogs  young kids skateboarding  older Asian couple waving walked  You see house Honda Accord driveway  one Kia Thule bike rack  You track yard signs local city council races  Aaron right  There really major difference one house next  It s like mansion sitting next row crumbling mill houses  I finished second tour neighborhood wiser redistricting I I d laced running shoes  Maybe  I thought  simply wasn t possible human spot differences patterns  Over last decade  political mapmaking turned art science  backed reams data  demographic political  public private  Political parties target individual homes people beyond voting patterns party affiliation  Now  assign number says like vote certain way based myriad data points  deep magazine subscriptions or  even  whether cat  But it s unclear data filters way maps  In August  North Carolina lawmakers released raw data used redraw highly contentious General Assembly districts  stuck mostly vote totals presidential  U S  Senate  state level races  Still  maybe computer become sentient  I d theory little notch map might completely computer generated therefore unexplainable in way engineer Facebook wouldn t able tell exactly News Feed displayed exact stories specific order  But Jane Pinsky  Coalition Lobbying Government Reform Raleigh  told machines taken completely  A human definitely drew line  contended  there s definite reason it s there  She also gave helpful piece information  Nearly every state country uses program draw districting lines  It s called Maptitude  And it s really expensive  Pinsky suggested I mess around free open source facsimile Maptitude named  nerdily  Dave s Redistricting  It s like SimCity politically motivated geography geeks  So I started creating makeshift 11th district  watching numbers change every new chunk I added  I understood nuance  A box showed  real time  whether district becoming red blue every click  But still didn t tell anything specific  I couldn t get house level anyway  I stumbled across clues  they  too  didn t get closer answer  The dividing line followed edges precincts West Asheville  split one them  precinct 14 2  Brucemont lies  But shifting individual houses Meadows  district didn t seem help much  In fact  mere 12 votes cast 2016 general election  10 went Meadows  Democratic opponent  The reason tiny tweak  then  wasn t overtly political  Things made sense I called guy named Blake Eppelstyn  Until 2015  Eppelstyn GIS director Asheville s planning department  meaning he d looked complex data rich maps city nearly every day decade  Recently  he d left go private sector  became obsessed political districts  started blogging  attended redistricting conferences  There simple explanation  said  nothing sort people lived house  many    Up 1960s  states almost never touched political boundaries  despite fact population growth shifts urban areas made populations wildly unequal  The U S  Supreme Court s landmark decision Baker v  Carr 1962 allowed court role declaring whether legislative districts constitutional  Two years later  court decreed Wesberry v  Sanders states draw congressional districts make nearly identical population  slew cases afterward held district state equal population possible  hew concept  one person  one vote  With modern mapping  it s possible make districts close equal  exactly equal  In North Carolina  9 13 districts population 733 499  according 2010 census  The four one fewer person  Court decisions shown districts  population equal  state compelling reason why  Thus  many states  including California  Connecticut  Florida Indiana  drew congressional districts exact number people statewide  By making district s population precisely same  mapmaker takes argument legal challenger s arsenal  What s another way make districts court friendly lawsuit proof  By following county lines  whenever possible  North Carolina 13 Congressional districts  splits 12 100 counties  Most splits urban areas  Activists say vote splitting that s work Asheville also work Democratic neighborhoods places like Fayetteville Greensboro  In places  density also makes easier subtly weave neighborhoods  methodically tweaking get population exact  work unable seen zoom in  That s Eppelstyn thinks work Brucemont  If West Asheville blue  doesn t matter exactly zig zag  long get population equal sides   It fair amount trial error  says  At point  mapmaker needed shift 12 people one district other  He found along Louisiana Avenue West Asheville  There one man could  absolute certainty  confirm this  Tom Hofeller  prolific Republican mapmaker drew last two sets North Carolina s maps  one created line  He picked phone home Raleigh  amiable chat hour  refused go record it  citing pending lawsuits redistricting  Other depositions  he s spoken record length 2012 profile The Atlantic  mentioned political maps aggressively tilted landscape one party s direction  like Texas s  could get tossed federal court  So  answers  equal population explanation likely boring  And that  really  point  To paraphrase late Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart  people consider gerrymandering like pornography  know see it  In North Carolina  used easy see  A Democrat controlled state legislature created 12th district 1992 majority minority district satisfy Voting Rights Act  In order get enough black voters  district followed interstates back roads Gastonia Durham  branching grab African Americans Charlotte  Winston Salem  Greensboro  In spots  wide lane I 85  The move worked  Democrat Mel Watt  African American  easily election 1992 serious challenger resigned 2014 take position Obama administration  The old 12th district held textbook case egregious racial gerrymandering  shape makeup went U S  Supreme Court five times  In May  justices said district unconstitutional packed many black voters it  then  redrawn Hofeller 2016 satisfy lower court decision  It fits inside Democratic section North Carolina s populous county  Mecklenburg  whites hold slight majority now  The partisan effect statewide  The packing Democratic leaning voters 12th makes surrounding districts safer Republicans   The redrawing 12th district 2016 ripple effect dividing line West Asheville  To keep official population district 733 498 733 499  line moved point west current location  could proof overall intent wasn t split neighborhood s votes half  rather put enough Democratic Asheville hyper Republican 10th district keep 11th safely Republican well  The 10th 11th district overwhelmingly white  thus  haven t challenged racial grounds  Voting Rights Act makes easier strike down  Lawsuits claim they re partisan gerrymander  many North Carolina lawyers eagerly awaiting Supreme Court s upcoming decision Wisconsin case  Gill v  Whitford  see whether new rules political data put place  But far  challenges 11th district haven t gone anywhere  said Pinsky  whose group filed lawsuits many state federal boundaries   The route we ve play North Carolina racial  said  On broader scale  move shifted Asheville new district hasn t gotten much national attention  When zoomed out  district doesn t look nearly contorted others  held legally  guarantees GOP winner  If you re Republican mapmaker  couldn t done better job  At post race gathering  author David Daley  who d run race selling book gerrymandering  20 pop  jumped onto bench speak runners  were  now  drinking beer   This one gerrymandered districts country  shouted crowd 300  But it s hard say  legally  gerrymandering even is  judicial decisions constantly shifting rules  One Republican consultant told judge tosses one set data  like race  it s possible use different data get outcome  indeed  North Carolina lawmakers redrew districts 2016 comply court order  result largely same  An Associated Press analysis June still found maps among Republican skewed country  Yes  sides it  In

stability almost 40 years  The economic crisis  emergence widespread corruption scandals conflict Catalonia finally shed light severe dysfunctions  It s become painfully apparent Spain needs new constituent process order establish transparent  democratic efficient institutions  History shows centralized Spain sustained authoritarian regime would place country outside democratic norms European Union  Madrid s suspension Catalan political autonomy imprisonment regional government clearly breach 1978 constitutional agreement  The fact steps taken coordination country s high courts definite sign Spain s lack essential separation legislative  executive judicial powers  In recent years  Catalan separatism grown considerably reaction encroaching state centralism  But ceiling pro independence support seems stabilized 50 percent votes   enough proclaim independent state  insufficient legitimize make viable  especially considering hostility significant minority Catalans large majority Spaniards  On hand  Spanish nationalism   disguised constitutional patriotism   increasingly vocal push turn Spain unitary state resembling France  But history shows centralized Spain sustained authoritarian regime would place country outside democratic norms European Union  Given current demographic political conditions  neither Catalan Republic dreamed independence movement homogenous Spain envisioned unionists take place without recourse forms violence people sides squarely reject  What done  then  If neither side impose project other  forced make concessions reach agreement  1978  This must begin recognition Catalans  like people  enjoy right self determination  International law already recognizes right  But essential reconciliation explicitly incorporated Spanish constitution vast majority Catalans feel integrated recognized consensual subjects Spain  This would automatically give Catalonia right secede create state  A new constitutional agreement must also offer guarantees Catalans Spaniards legitimately aspire preserve territorial integrity current state  The recognition right self determination accompanied law clarity   along lines 2000 Clarity

level symbolic international recognition different national identities  A federal confederal framework crucial internal self determination viable effective Spain  But practically impossible type reform carried without first accepting restricted right constitutional path independence  That would force Spain s central institutions demographic majorities respect seek stable agreements devolved authorities like Catalan government  Equally  making difficult access independence without broad consensus territory s population would force authorities seek stable agreements central institutions  discouraging pursuing unilateral solutions  To avoid escalation current conflict  Spain urgently needs engage new constituent process  Next year  instead celebrating 40th anniversary Spanish

annexation Crimea happened early 2014  What I saw Russia online social media around grave violation Ukraine s sovereignty revelation   nothing short trial run manipulate presidential election 2016  Few Americans realized back then  already global information war Russia  But know  On Saturday morning I d job two months   four weeks Vladimir Putin s troops invaded Crimea   I got call State Department operations center saying secretary line  Only wasn t Secretary John Kerry  boss  former Secretary Hillary Clinton  I known  liked admired Clinton long time  I assumed calling belatedly say congratulations  I wrong  After perfunctory hello  launched right it  We re losing information war Russia  She urged stand much stronger robust messaging machine compete firehose Russian propaganda disinformation besmirching America s image undermining democracy around world   They re using old techniques repeating lies 21st century platforms  said  You need fact check saying expose Russian disinformation real time  continued  We need much more  I remember ended call   The State Department still issuing press releases Putin rewriting history  She right  But still new me  Even though I

green men    least that s TV news described masked men unmarked uniforms skulked Crimea March 2014  In fact   Spetsnaz  Russian special operations forces  At time  Putin vehemently denied Russian troops  He claimed patriotic local militias defending rights ethnic Russians Crimea  This  course  unblinking lie  Within days  Putin illegally annexed piece Ukraine Russian federation copped fact indeed Russian soldiers  The White House condemned violation Crimea s sovereignty began process imposing sanctions Russia  At time  I thought least marshal social media historic trespass  Some folks made fun called  hashtag diplomacy  heck  something  I started tweeting Putin Russia s actions urged everyone State Department social media account    The unshakeable principle guiding events must people  Ukraine determine future  Not exactly fire breathing words  At time  started small social media group called Ukraine Task Force rebut Russian lies real time  And funny thing happened  I started getting dozens hundreds tweets calling fascist propagandist hypocrite much  much worse  And almost terrible spelling worse grammar  In addition  tweets scantily clad young women who  syntactically challenged English mixed Cyrillic  inquired political views breathlessly told theirs  I received screeds Russian babies kidnapped Crimea  unrepentant Nazis behind protests downtown Kiev

Peter Getty Images Fox  facing new competitors  clings tighter Trump The network sparred candidate rarely questions him  During Republican primary contest  Donald Trump feuded frequently Fox News  going Megyn Kelly and  height pique  even skipping one network s debates  That seems like eons ago  When staunch Trump supporter Laura Ingraham launched new 10 p m  show last week  represented capstone yearlong remaking Fox News Trump s image  It also signaled Fox fears increasing competition right flank   I ve read stories Murdochs soured Donald Trump  would know programming decisions  said Charlie Sykes  longtime conservative radio host MSNBC contributor   It certainly reflects business model conservative media right now  Pro Trump viewers want safe space  They want reliable outlet defend president attack critics Fox apparently decided it s going give that  As drive point home  Fox News made waves weekend pulling air ad calling president s impeachment  Networks typically run ads political stripes  regardless ideology  60 second impeachment spot  funded liberal billionaire Tom Steyer  proved offensive many network s viewers   Due strong negative reaction ad viewers  could good conscience take money  Jack Abernethy  co president Fox News  said statement  On Tuesday night Wednesday  Fox hosts uniformly downplayed idea Trump factor Democratic victories Virginia New Jersey  taking pains drive home president s assertion Virginia GOP gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie erred embracing closely enough  Chris Ruddy  CEO rival conservative platform Newsmax Trump ally  said even taken aback Fox hosts  unwillingness criticize president  If Fox shifted protect right  Ruddy believes there s opening conservative outlet feels less reflexively defensive Trump   Newsmax supportive president  also publish things critical time time  Ruddy said   Fox seems decided become closely aligned  seems unnatural  doesn t seem consistent   For people believe Fox always pro Trump  miss significance hard shift last 18 months    Radio host Charlie Sykes  It s bizarre I think lose credibility news organization  continued  Fox News declined additional comment story  Though Fox News remains tops ratings  competition swirling around network  The conservative Sinclair Broadcast Group working complete  3 9 billion takeover Tribune Broadcasting  would allow free broadcasts reach 72 percent U S  households  Ruddy s Newsmax TV currently nowhere near Fox s reach  also looking grow  POLITICO reported recently signed deal DISH Network increase distribution  And Ruddy scheduled meet Bill O Reilly week New York discuss potential spot network  Rumors also linked O Reilly Sinclair  though CEO president  Chris Ripley  denied interest  Beyond TV world  host sites   starting Breitbart   threaten Fox News  primacy discourse right   There s lot conservative media there  said Joseph Bonner  senior analyst communications technology Argus Research   If Fox thinks threat right Trumpists  however want put it  inoculate threat  want point view  Less year ago  Fox News prime time lineup featured O Reilly Kelly  addition ardently pro Trump Sean Hannity  While neither O Reilly Kelly s shows exactly bastions liberal politics  Kelly famously took Trump  And though Trump supporter  O Reilly  forced Fox News April wake multiple sexual harassment allegations  occasionally showed willingness buck Trump line  Their replacements  Ingraham Tucker Carlson  almost never break president  The week starting show  Ingraham appeared Steve Bannon political rally Kelli Ward  hard right Arizona Senate candidate challenging Trump critic Jeff Flake   seemingly naked declaration Ingraham political operative journalist   It s quite significant pivot  For people believe Fox always pro Trump  miss significance hard shift last 18 months  Sykes said   Fox really turning self consciously virtually house organ Trump administration  Particularly noteworthy  said  network s recent embrace Hillary Clinton related stories seem designed deflect attention special counsel Robert Mueller s Russia investigation   There s nothing conservative ideas  This size government  tax cuts  This defending regime legal attack  Sykes said  Some Fox News anchors  like Shepard Smith  Bret Baier Chris Wallace  remained willing sound discordant notes  Fox added additional news programming since election  including just launched newscast 11 p m  But Clinton focused stories found significant airtime Fox s news programming  well   far network  In past  Fox News  Roger Ailes  sought lead viewers ideologically  The network  instance  forward edge promoting tea party movement Barack Obama s first term president  Now  though  Ailes gone Fox appears focused meeting viewers are  That is  part  network faces far different media ecosystem today  In old days  Fox free set agenda  But explosion popularity social media conservative sites like Breitbart  Infowars The Gateway Pundit forced network make sure doesn t get left behind whatever bubbling online   I think Fox making decision Trump making  double appeal hard core base  Sykes said   They didn t hire Laura Ingraham want get viewers MSNBC  The access provided cozying Trump   Fox s No  1 viewer   boon network  said Brian Wieser  senior analyst Pivotal Research  Since took office  Trump granted 19 interviews Fox News Fox Business Channel  compared two NBC MSNBC  one ABC News  one CBS News zero CNN   They ve certainly found Trump s ear  said   They know there s advantage access  I suspect that s important element sheer ideology  After Ingraham  whose name previously surfaced potential Trump press secretary  interviewed president Thursday  The Washington Post described interview as   as obliging would expected someone previously contemplated role president s official mouthpiece  Trump s appearance Ingraham s show caused significant spike ratings  3 million people tuning in  according Nielsen  compared 2 36 million night before  Whether conservative challenger could potentially dent Fox News remains open question  Wieser said would incredibly difficult  requiring  hundreds millions dollars upfront capital commitments   I look ratings regular basis clearly Fox outrageously well  said Charles Herring  president Fox rival One America Network s parent company  Herring Networks   I believe anybody who s trying compete uphill battle  we ve able carve really nice audience independents right wing individuals  believe there s lot upside potential growth  Herring believes Fox News viewers could react negatively network s daytime news programs hard core pro Trump viewpoint prime time opinion lineup   If you re viewer  you re getting two different messages  depending you re watching day evening prime time lineup  And I think that s really tough act channel do  try appeal two audiences  said  Though it s unlikely conservative challenger could immediately come along knock Fox News pedestal  another outlet grabbed even enough viewers allow surging MSNBC sneak ahead Fox ratings  would blow network  long made No  1 status central branding   It s cable television  Bragging rights relevant  Bonner  analyst  said  Ruddy said Fox s success proof there s plenty room conservative market  especially network willing offer  constructive criticism  Trump   My view we re challenging Fox  we re adding diversity marketplace  Ruddy said   Tucker  Laura Hannity  that s going predictable lineup largely  My view would independent voices  I think long run better conservatives  it s better President Trump

BOYLE  Thank you  GROSS  And I know little bit laryngitis thank coming spite that  So make distinction employment  Homeboy Industries  give people jobs 18 month period  people either prison gangs want change life  You make distinction  You say that  like  employment isn t necessarily going totally change someone s life  They might end back prison  But somebody s healed  change life possibly forever  What s distinction make employment opportunity you re giving healing  BOYLE  Thirty years ago started Homeboy Industries  know  motto nothing stops bullet like job  response gang members saying work  And essential  discovered that  know  would dispatch gang members jobs  But minute kind monkey wrench tossed mix  would unravel  know  resilience  There healing  And would go right back gang life go back prison  So kind of  probably 15 years ago  said  know  healing probably necessary along fact people need reason get morning place go reason gang bang  So kind altered essential way people don t foundational  fundamental healing  know  it s going really difficult navigate lives  And altered kind fundamental stance finding job every gang member employing us also trying come terms whatever suffering they ve trauma  GROSS  So sounds great  Healing really life changing  It s really hard  I mean  people describe book you ve worked with  there s one person who  child  took batteries father

Peterman start Sunday    Joe Buscaglia  JoeBuscaglia  November 15  2017 Peterman played late last Sunday s blowout loss New Orleans Saints  McDermott said loss Tyrod Taylor still starter going forward  Today  told media made decision switch quarterback Tuesday  READ MORE  Bills  Tyrod Taylor benched   I don t agree decision  McDermott says decision becoming better team   Bills HC Sean McDermott  Tyrod made improvements  He s made significant contribution team  I remain confident moving forward    Joe Buscaglia  JoeBuscaglia  November 15  2017  Bills HC Sean McDermott  As continue grow move direction I want us go  going difficult decisions    Joe Buscaglia  JoeBuscaglia  November 15  2017 McDermott said Sunday Saints loss  Monday  Taylor starter  He said made decision change quarterbacks Tuesday  informed entire team choice Wednesday morning  When asked would permanent move  one time start  McDermott replied   We ll see  Joe B s Take Well  I certainly wasn t expecting kick things Wednesday morning  Considering standings  still holding one two Wild Card positions AFC first 10 weeks  genuine surprise Bills team played well first seven games season  What transpired last two weeks  though  seemed enough Bills pull trigger move Taylor bench second time career Bills  And admittedly  I wrong  I didn t think Bills would make move long playoff breath  That s usual logic within NFL  Bills defied usual logic  respect  The Bills desperate offense something try counter Saints Sunday  got next nothing Taylor rarely took chances field   opted check large margin second half  When Peterman came in  I expecting prevent defense run Saints game well garbage time  However  Saints zone coverage  certainly wasn t soft zone Peterman something haven t seen much Taylor  He threw ball anticipation multiple times  game 11 plays  Peterman attacked short intermediate areas field  clearly best offense looked since first series game   without running game  Now  also consider threw pair really errant passes Saints didn t full starting defense game  Even still  reviewing game All 22 Tuesday  hard come away game least tad impressed rookie bench two and a half months  However  let s kid ourselves  timing shocking  McDermott seemed hellbent winning year gave real indication appearances media Sunday Monday even consideration  Taylor popular entity within locker room  well  Players like LeSean McCoy incredibly vocal support Taylor  even going lengths saying doesn t know Taylor doesn t get credit things field  This decision likely unpopular one players grown deeply respect appreciate everything Taylor puts job  Taylor seemed slightly progress areas Bills desired to  He settled pocket much past years  earlier season  drove ball field highlight reel throws  However  always one lingering question  Did actually fit offense offensive coordinator Rick Dennison wanted run  Early year even preseason  clear Taylor wasn t comfortable certain parts offense  Most notably  Taylor line center perform either three five step drop  It didn t come naturally Taylor  starter  evolved mostly shotgun based scheme  As uncovered Matthew Fairburn NYUpstate com  Bills started tinkering blocking schemes near middle year try generate offensively  would think byproduct able operate center without short drops keep defense honest enough  If I guess  despite Sean McDermott saying decision  I would tend believe Peterman s natural fit Dennison offense one offensive coordinator pushed head coach  Now  question is  see  We ll likely see lot anticipatory throws rookie  welcomed sight Bills fans wanting Taylor past two and a half seasons  What also means we ll see much offense shown preseason earlier season  I d anticipate see less shotgun  three five step drops  lot play action help take pressure running game  We re also going see lot errant throws Peterman saw Taylor  turn  we re going see Bills likely turn ball bit we ve grown accustomed past seasons  Peterman take chances field Taylor  certainly isn t afraid tight window throw  His deep accuracy something I d like see improve  helm  Dennison wants shot taken  taken   we re bound see it  Let s also forget GM Brandon Beane said repeatedly offseason number one belief trait quarterback able possess  good pocket passer  And Taylor certainly improved past years  still shown much hesitation pocket rookie Peterman better fit style offense  What also signals even though Bills playoff race  still first year trying do  rebuild roster highest level   short term gains  In respect  I like boldness move  despite timing little peculiar  I ve impressed McDermott Beane s ability turn roster still remaining competitive year  falls line bold moves they ve made since days training camp started  They long haul  it s abundantly clear don t believe Taylor part plan  While may come situation Peterman struggles need go back Taylor stretch season  don t fooled  unless something drastic occurs end season  Taylor isn t plans Bills moving forward  You simply can t make move point season  put stuffing back toy pass brand new  They knew magnitude decision signals moving forward important position sports  chose go it  There chance season Taylor could work way plans showing signs progress pocket  regression certain key points season likely sealed fate  I think Taylor solid quarterback helped stay games turning ball over  he s likely find least competition starting job elsewhere 2018  It s clear Bills don t value enough start crucial game Week 11  turn  makes notion keeping  18 million 2018 bit longshot  However  Taylor s ceiling  Was going lead team Super Bowl  Probably not  Was good enough get team playoffs  Most likely  yes  But it s clear McDermott s statements Wednesday goal bigger playoffs  want win Super Bowl Buffalo  I like bold moves  I like going fourth down  I like going two point conversion often not  I would hypocrite I said I didn t like going limb like Bills  Too often  we ve seen Bills try enough save jobs  stay competitive  go limb fear unknown  That longer case  They extended look see Peterman guy year future  long holds job  he s going two best teams AFC three separate times  Kansas City  New England  really good defense Los Angeles Chargers  Do Bills quarterback future Nathan Peterman  We don t know  Bills find   ample evidence   go important offseason McDermott Beane era try reshape roster sustained success  And I  one  can t wait see unfold  Twitter   JoeBuscaglia,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hopefully help people  Signs whether it s working may come month  tests show sure three months  If it s successful  could give major boost fledgling field gene therapy   Scientists edited people s

earlier gene therapies  One worry virus might provoke immune system attack  In 1999  18 year old Jesse Gelsinger died gene therapy study problem  new studies use different virus that s proved much

Care Act s individual mandate long loathed  For years  critics bill said law s requirement Americans either obtain insurance pay fine coercive unfair  The mandate brought Supreme Court case nearly toppled whole Affordable Care Act  Public opinion polls consistently show ordinary Americans dislike   Even many Obamacare s authors talked mandate  As presidential candidate  Barack Obama campaigned health plan didn t punish people went without health coverage  Mitt Romney  whose Massachusetts health reform bill blueprint Obamacare  also initially hoped plan without mandate  Now turns getting rid mandate could help Republicans tackle difficult math tax reform  According recent Congressional Budget Office estimate   eliminating mandate could lower deficit  338 billion decade  A third trillion dollars help pay lot tax cuts  Which Senate Republicans  trying find funding keep promise dismantle Obamacare  vowing add mandate repeal tax bill  But there s reason Obamacare s authors kept provision unpleasant unpopular   And there s reason budget office said cutting would save much money  Without mandate  economic studies suggested  fewer healthy people would buy health insurance  Their exit market would raise insurance prices  driving still healthy people unhappy spiral rising prices lower rates insurance coverage  The mandate often compared one support three legged stool made Obamacare work  Knock out  whole apparatus would tip over  broken useless  That logic persuaded Mr  Romney put mandate health bill  thinking persuaded President Obama change mind put Affordable Care Act  Without mandate  C B O  said years  premiums would spike  millions fewer Americans would health insurance  The budget office s recent estimate  published last week  said ranks uninsured would rise 13 million 10 years  average premiums would 10 percent higher current law  If wanted health reform work  thinking went  needed eat broccoli individual mandate  could enjoy dessert health care system accessible people pre existing illnesses   Much debate oral argument Supreme Court focused hypothetical broccoli purchase mandates  The insurance industry  concerned left operating unsustainable market  particularly exercised emphasizing point every turn  On Tuesday  sent letter congressional leaders urging preserve mandate  For years  conservative health care analysts said budget office erred assuming insurance requirement much power gets health insurance  Under budget office s estimates  eliminating mandate doesn t drive people individual insurance market  people pay premiums buy coverage  also sharply lowers number people enrolled Medicaid  program low income Americans access largely without cost them  Republican critics said Medicaid estimates unrealistic unfair health reform plan doesn t include mandate  But Republicans embracing long described mandate s overstated importance  That s way measure could achieve  338 billion savings causing many fewer Americans government subsidized health insurance  Most savings budget office s calculations regarding repealing mandate come lowering Medicaid enrollment  If budget office took Republican critiques heart  mandate would much less useful component tax reform  And appears budget office has  indeed  heard complaints  In recent report  economists indicated office re evaluating assessment mandate   The agencies undertaken considerable work revise methods estimate effects repealing individual mandate  report notes near end  While work completed time assess current tax proposal  new estimates ready soon  Under new model   the estimated effects budget health insurance coverage would probably smaller numbers reported document  report says  That make mandate less central success future health care overhaul ideas  And less valuable means pay tax cuts  The Upshot provides news  analysis graphics politics  policy everyday life  Follow us Facebook Twitter   Sign newsletter  Order Reprints   Today s

closely watched shareholder vote Tuesday Procter   Gamble portraying fount creativity  In mid September presentation designed block Trian s co founder  Nelson Peltz  winning seat board  P G extolled leadership  innovation  spotlighting term headlines fewer four consecutive slides for example   P G Innovation Drives New Brands Blockbuster New Sub Brands  In reality  P G s obvious exercise innovation highly creative numbers it s advertising rebuff Trian  bolster claim mediocre looking results really good  view P G way  Never U S  corporate history activist launched proxy contest versus

5 billion stake  argues P G fading  cumbersome giant suffering stifling bureaucracy  dearth exciting new products  eroding market share aging brands  P G counters it s rebounding strongly CEO David Taylor  Peltz aims upend winning strategy  The eight month duel reach decisive showdown P G s annual meeting October 10  Retail investors voting months  big institutions mostly waited verdicts three big proxy advisory firms late September  ISS  Glass Lewis Egan Jones all backed Peltz before casting ballots  The vote close call  last minute ballots could still presented meeting shareholders attendance  By noon Tuesday  Taylor expected announce one three results  Peltz wins  P G prevails  count tight outcome can t yet determined  In case  could take many weeks certify vote declare victor  The best way pierce barrage claims  counter claims  counter counter claims determine whose numbers reveal real P G  The best gauge two sides  positions widely contrasting views perhaps important measure  P G s record growing investors prize most  earnings per share  What counts  core  In anti Trian presentations recent financials  P G presents earnings per share originally reported financial statements   core  EPS  adjusted special non recurring items gains losses asset sales  restructuring costs shuttering subsidiary Venezuela  Using adjusted numbers widely accepted  including Trian  What s questionable that  highlighting results fiscal 2011 2017  ended June  P G also reaches back exclude past profits businesses it s sold six years  And it s axed heap businesses along them  profits  The long list includes Duracell  Pringles  Folgers  IAMS pet foods  beauty franchise featuring Clairol Cover Girl  P G argues methodology displays well it s managed businesses still owns  hence provides guide well anointed brands perform future  In presentations  P G shows core EPS growing  3 48  3 92 FY 2011 2017  total 12 6  annual growth rate 2  That s darn good  claims P G  given tough global market consumer products strong headwinds surging dollar  But results really show P G s growing profits core portfolio  Or supposed improvement really result gigantic share buybacks  lot P G shouldn t even counting  So let s separate two factors determine growth EPS  expansion numerator the underlying profits businesses P G still owns  trend denominator  decline  in case  number shares outstanding  If P G great job managing core businesses  numerator  profits number  growing briskly  But that s hardly case  By measure  P G s core earnings rose  10 44 billion FY 2011  10 749 billion 2017  increase 3  Hence  increase EPS six years came shrinking denominator driven buybacks   Buybacks tend improve earnings per share  fewer shares across spread profits  And EPS swelling buybacks may belong P G s adjusted numbers all  From FY 2011 2017  P G deployed ambitious program repurchases lower share count 3 billion 2 742 billion  reduction 258 million  Hence  9 point reduction shares outstanding accounts three quarters 12  rise EPS  To sure  12  6 years hardly great  But modest progress P G achieved mainly attributable buybacks  puny contribution earnings  Although failure grow underlying profits troublesome  raising EPS via buybacks may good thing  if  P G asserts  looming comeback proves shares deeply undervalued  But here s gap P G s credibility  A big chunk funds used repurchase shares  drive EPS  didn t come earnings generated current  core brands all  Over six years  according cash flow statements  P G raised  9 8 billion selling businesses  It also collected additional  5 6 billion profits divested brands still owed them  So effect  bygone businesses generated  15 billion extra funds available purchasing shares  By Fortune s rough estimates  funds paid three quarters 258 million shares purchased FY 2011 2017  Put simply  P G saying  here s would done we d never owned now divested  and poorly performing  businesses  But presenting results  we re including  15 billion proceeds sales businesses  never owned  So let s consistent  add back shares P G repurchased cash reaped departed brands  Under scenario  EPS rose 2  less 1  annually  5 5  six years  less half advertised amount  In basic terms  5 5  sum 3  total earnings growth 6 years  plus 2 5  reduction share count didn t come brands axed along way  So shareholders ask whether 5 5  gain six years supports management s claim businesses constitute new  slimmed down P G prospering   By way  5 5  didn t come close matching inflation  A better yardstick In fact  Trian right  The best yardstick core earnings originally reported  numbers include businesses  divested current  buybacks  That number provides pure measure earnings businesses contribute every share P G stock  And number hasn t moved six years  Indeed  report endorsing Peltz s candidacy  Glass Lewis harshly critical P G s methodology   By combining favorable EPS impact disposal funded share buybacks downward adjustments historical earnings attributable divested businesses  P G able show favorable Core EPS growth time  despite effective loss operational earnings power  writes Glass Lewis  concluding   We concerned management s presentation earnings growth inflated  Albert Meyer  forensic accountant founder Texas portfolio manager Bastiat Funds  also finds P G s approach misleading   They want cake eat too  says Meyer   When make adjustments  need consistent  It isn t consistent leave businesses sold  include proceeds selling businesses  Using consistent numbers shows P G s stock done poorly  Of course  P G claims results would look stellar weren t dollar surge pounded overseas earnings converted greenbacks  That argument doesn t impress Meyer   If make decision go abroad  take account  declares   My experience evens time  If make smart investment  forex big factor  If forex factor  may wasn t good business start with  wasn t executed properly  P G maintains it s eagerly embracing change  best course management pursue today s strategy unfettered Peltz  pace  The proof  say board brass  historic transformation well underway  But  adjusted  numbers  re adjusted erase gimmicks  prove opposite  The best hope shareholders Peltz wins  peace made  voice owner outsider helps reinvigorate sleeping giant ,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

www.washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/11/15/how-to-reduce-the-tax-on-women-in-national-security/,How reduce tax women national security,Former secretary state Madeleine Albright introduces Hillary Clinton presidential campaign event Rundlett Middle School Concord  N H  2016   AP  Last week  hard working staff Spoiler Alerts relayed firsthand observations myriad ways women face extra set challenges national security community  I concluded  Reading responses  struck ongoing tax women reported experiencing  Even facing outright harassment  constantly navigate work environment inappropriate problematic norms display  Each women reported constant internal debate protest  minor  infractions  These problems I never deal entire professional career  I imagine less productive I would coping additional layer challenges  So  there s problem  This week  Spoiler Alerts focuses little bit possible solutions  Actually   solutions  might strong word  None women national security I queried thinks problem go away anytime soon  But best practices might help  Think what s discussed way implement significant gender tax cut field  And like tax cuts  So suggestions  ranging obvious less obvious  Hire promote  know  women This banal  particular workplace gender balanced  less likely kinds taxes talked last week exist  Mara Karlin  former DoD official professor practice SAIS  told me   Be careful ducks choosing ducks  When you re hiring asked recommend someone opportunity  think twice go candidates  Ensure considered different types people  The way we ll diversity national security table facilitating diversity backbenchers  Some might think affirmative action  CFR s Alyssa Ayres argues opposite true  When people think candidates roles  think would call expertise  roster look like  Is filled dynamic young men drive lot expertise experience  If answer yes  ask women are  There frankly isn t reason type bias erasure anymore  given many women significant expertise broader field  You actively selecting highly qualified women end male dominated job slates  manels  media voices whatever  No one  lower  qualifications draw upon women  fact objection even comes points larger problem first place  Speaking qualifications  here s advice whether women interested national security take PhD route  Modeling good behavior moment Brookings Institution senior fellow Tamara Cofman Wittes wrote authority model good behavior  less likely others tempted act bad manner  Demonstrating modeling inclusion   is  visibly consistently treating female colleagues fellow experts admire respect   THE MOST IMPORTANT THING men every day create culture work entitled  creepy a holes don t feel like pull sexist crap women office get away it  The respect show one another  diverse workplace becomes  less room a holes a holes  It s simple  really  This echoes another woman worked civilian capacity Defense Department told me   It incumbent upon senior leaders establish environment subjected sexual harassment recognize allegations viewed legitimate addressed accordingly  What struck also many said responses sexual harassment incidents need quick decisive  Geopolitical risk analyst Milena Rodban urged   We need call kind behavior  immediately  constructive fashion  A junior scholar told me   It helps LOT men call harassment bulls  see it        When men step say   You interrupted her   Let talk   How said different said  helps lot  Including Twitter social media platforms  This interesting challenge men want act constructive manner  For decades  skeptics sexual harassment claims asked women come forward immediately harassment occurs  My hunch men slow react real time  The fundamental awkwardness calling someone workplace environment makes silence seem easier  Resist temptation awkward humor When issues come workplace  I fight instinct crack joke way easing tension  According Wittes  I continue throttle instinct submission  Hey  get it s uncomfortable  It s uncomfortable us  we ve trying laugh off  OUR WHOLE PROFESSIONAL LIVES  Don t guy whose behavior tells us that s need keep doing  Making joke issue comes like sticking Post it forehead women colleagues read says  If anything awful happens you  I going help  This men  either  One private sector consultant acknowledged tendency use humor cope sexualized behavior workplace worked set bad precedent   In protecting   deflecting  sparing  snapping   I done nothing help women field  If anything  I likely made lot worse playing men s games laughing ridiculous  ham fisted comments  Lead example Women advanced management positions national security institutions need eliminate residual stigmas disproportionately affect women  Amy Zegart  co director Stanford University s Center International Security Arms Control  proffered one example  Until year  I never talked leaving office see kids game concert  Now I am  Men leave office something kids tend seen great involved dads  Women tend seen fully committed jobs  These unconscious biases get addressed talk consciously  That s exactly I m doing  Don t adopt Pence rule In wake harassment episodes  claimed maybe would good idea men adopt Vice President Pence s rule   He never eats alone woman wife won t attend events featuring alcohol without side  Sebastian Gorka heartily endorses rule well  although informed sources say practice himself  And there s NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch  Remember left trashed Mike Pence respecting wife women dinner rule    Dana Loesch  DLoesch  November 12  2017 While I understand Pence s motivations  kind rule harms women helps them  This particularly true foreign policy national security  fields require lot evening work  out of town conferences overseas travel  Earlier year  first came up  Andrew Exum explained Atlantic Pence rule problematic women seeking professional advancement  Rules like vice president follows likewise harm professional development   professional opportunities afforded   women  If  either governor Indiana vice president United States  Mike Pence would share glass scotch end day male subordinate way would female subordinate  creates obviously unfair advantage men working Pence  Leaders private public sectors careful creating unequal opportunities mentorship professional development        I recently completed two years manager federal government I led 45 person team men women I often traveled internationally  As manager  never occurred I might dine one female subordinates abroad  Leaving aside merits dinner companion  afford opportunities professionally I afforded male subordinates would grossly unfair  Here s simple way delineating costs  Imagine gender balance reversed  women authority decided implement variant Pence rule  Would men seeking advancement national security tolerate obvious gap mentoring opportunities  All women I queried made quite clear disapproved Pence rule  Senior junior  married single  Republican Democrat  said costs outweighed perceived benefit  The Hoover Institution s Kori Schake told me   The Pence rule pernicious  especially young women  The best decision rule I ve heard Walt Slocombe  former undersecretary defense policy  guys soft behavior  if gay man boss acted way  would I freaked out    None actions solve problem  The private sector consultant told me   Given power dynamics play  I don t see real opportunities change age experience power lines don t track gender  That means need senior women midcareer women  But many thrown hands face similar experiences left field  Perhaps actions  and non actions case Pence rule  nudge things much positive trajectory ,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Parlament und zu den Gerichten  Das Militr mit dem Putsch offenbar verhindern  dass Mugabes 52 jhrige Frau Grace die Spitze des Staates rckt  Ihr Aufstieg und der ihr nachgesagte ausschweifende Lebensstil werden selbst von vielen Anhngern des 93 jhrigen Staatschefs abgelehnt  Generalmajor Moyo sagte  Verbrechen der  Kriminellen  um Mugabe htten soziales und wirtschaftliches Leid verursacht  Die Verantwortlichen mssten vor Gericht gestellt werden   Sobald wir unsere Mission erfllt haben  erwarten wir eine Rckkehr zur Normalitt  BUNDESREGIERUNG RUFT ZU GEWALTVERZICHT AUF Die Bundesregierung rief alle Konfliktparteien zum Gewaltverzicht auf   Erforderlich ist ein Dialog der Akteure  um eine Konfrontation zu vermeiden und zu einer friedlichen Lsung zu kommen  sagte ein Sprecher des Auswrtigen Amtes   nL8N1NL4MU  Die deutsche Botschaft bleibt ebenso wie die Vertretungen anderer Staaten geschlossen  Deutschland  die USA und Grobritannien empfahlen ihren Staatsbrgern Simbabwe  wegen der unsicheren Lage den Husern zu bleiben  Auch der britische Auenminister Boris Johnson appellierte alle Seiten der ehemaligen Kolonie  keine Gewalt anzuwenden  Sdafrikas Prsident Zuma kndigte an  seiner Eigenschaft als Vorsitzender der Entwicklungsgemeinschaft des sdlichen Afrika einen Sondergesandten nach Simbabwe zu schicken  Dieser solle mit Mugabe und Armeevertretern zusammenkommen  In den Straen der Hauptstadt patrouillierten Soldaten  Das Militr besetzte den staatlichen Fernsehsender  Augenzeugen zufolge erschtterten drei Explosionen das Zentrum von Harare  Insgesamt schien es aber ruhig der Metropole  ENTLASSUNG DES VIZEPRSIDENTEN SORGTE FR ESKALATION Militrchef Constantino Chiwenga hatte Anfang der Woche der Regierung gedroht einzugreifen  nachdem Vizeprsident Emmerson Mnangagwa entlassen worden war  Mnangagwa galt bis dahin offiziell als Nachfolger Mugabes  Seine Entlassung sollte offenbar den Weg fr Grace Mugabe die Staatsspitze freimachen  Das sorgte nicht nur bei vielen Veteranen des Unabhngigkampfes fr Unmut  sondern auch der Armeefhrung  die Mnangagwa untersttzte  Einige Generle erklrten  sie wrden niemanden der Spitze des Staates akzeptieren  der nicht im Unabhngigkeitskrieg den 70er Jahren gekmpft habe  Mugabe fhrt die Geschicke des Landes seit der Unabhngigkeit 1980  Beunruhigt ber die Entwicklung war anscheinend auch China  das wirtschaftlich Simbabwe stark engagiert ist und viele Rohstoffe von dort bezieht  Vorige Woche reiste Simbabwes Armeechef Chiwenga nach Peking  wo er von Verteidigungsminister Chang Wanquan empfangen wurde  Chinas Regierung sprach von einem normalen militrischen Austausch  Der Besuch stehe keinem Zusammenhang mit den aktuellen Entwicklungen nL8N1NL2SE  SIMBABWE SEIT DER UNABHNGIGKEIT IM NIEDERGANG Simbabwe war den 80er Jahren eines der wirtschaftlich erfolgreichsten Lnder Afrikas  Inzwischen steckt es einer anhaltend tiefen Wirtschaftskrise  fr die Gegner  aber auch langjhrige Wegbegleiter Mugabes den Prsidenten verantwortlich machen  Zugleich fhlt sich die alte Garde der Guerillakmpfer des Unabhngigkeitskrieges von Mugabes Frau Grace ins Abseits gestellt  die sich vor allem auf die Parteijugend sttzt   Das ist die Korrektur eines Staates Abgrund  sagte Chris Mutsvangwa  der Fhrer der Veteranen des Befreiungskrieges und fgt hinzu   Das ist das Ende eines sehr schmerzvollen und traurigen Kapitels einer jungen Nation  dem ein Diktator  als er alt wurde  seinen Hof einer Bande von Dieben um seine Frau berlie   nL8N1NL422  Finanzminister Ignatius Chombo  der zur einflussreichen Gruppe um Grace Mugabe gethlt wird  wurde nach Informationen aus Regierungskreisen festgenommen  Simbabwe trudelt derzeit wieder eine schwere Wirtschaftskrise  Viele befrchten  dass sie noch schlimmer werden knnte als der Zusammenbruch 2007 2008  Damals lag die Inflationsrate der Spitze bei 500 Milliarden Prozent  Gegenwrtig werden bereits wieder Importgter knapp  Die Inflationsrate liegt bei 50 Prozent im Monat  Aus Geheimdienstdokumenten  die die Nachrichtenagentur Reuters Einblick erhielt  geht hervor  dass der entlassene Vizeprsident Mnangagwa fr eine Wiederbelebung der Wirtschaft Tausende vor 20 Jahren von ihrem Land vertriebene weie Farmer wieder ins Land holen wollte  Auerdem wollte er den Dokumenten zufolge die abgebrochenen Beziehungen zur Weltbank und zum Internationalen Whrungsfonds wiederherstellen ,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

www.cnn.com,http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/health/four-day-workweek/index.html,A four day workweek could hazardous health,Many employers employees love thought four day workweek   Supposedly  four day work schedule allows workers extra time pursue leisure activities family togetherness  Spurred visions spending time beach  many people encouraging businesses adopt kind work plan  There many purported advantages   Some authorities say four day work schedule facilitates ability provide child care assistance elderly  Proponents  compressed  work schedules   employees work longer hours fewer days week   point gains productivity result decreased overhead costs   keep lights nobody working  Additional cost savings obtained reducing total weekly commuting time A variety business tested four day concept  including Amazon  Google  Deloitte host smaller firms  Amazon announced late August experimenting even shorter workweek 30 hours select employees  would earn 75 percent full time salary  choose opt in  Many pilot programs shown promising results  Statistics Society Human Resource Management indicate 31 percent employees compressed workweek schedule 2015  That s case  however  5 percent large companies  This issue I considerable experience  I studying health effects long working hours nearly 30 years  All studies point potential dangers occur result additional risks created work demands exceed particular threshold  Most studies I performed suggest dangers pronounced people regularly work 12 hours per day 60 hours per week  It sounded like good idea The idea four day workweek new  Labor experts studying advocating approaches since 1970s  For example  2008  researchers Brigham Young University conducted series surveys among employees community members assess perspectives four day workweek  The researchers found four fifths employees reported positive experience working type schedule  Based positive results  Utah s governor enacted mandatory four day workweek state employees  The state s goal curb energy costs  improve air quality  ensure needed services would still available  for instance  garbage collection  help recruit retain state employees  In 2011  however  Utah reversed course  saying savings never materialized  Other research also supported development adoption compressed work schedules  A 1989 study found compressed schedules  PDF  related high levels job satisfaction employees  satisfaction work schedules  supervisors also reported pleased four day workweek schedules  Are hidden dangers  Despite widespread enthusiasm four day week  I convinced kind schedule beneficial employees businesses  The primary problem idea whatever work needs done  needs get done amount total time  Despite wishes contrary  still 24 hours day  The math simple  working five eight hour shifts equivalent working four 10 hour shifts  That s true  But implications schedules different  The danger disregarding health effects occur result fatigue stress accumulate longer than normal working day  I performed study showing risk suffering industrial accident raised 37 percent employees working 12 hours day  The risk 61 percent higher people  overtime  shifts  Working 60 hours week related additional injury risk 23 percent  As hours worked schedules increase  risks grow accordingly  More recently  Dr  Xiaoxi Yao  colleague mine Mayo Clinic  I recently performed another study using 32 years work hour information analyze relationship long working hours many years risk diagnosed chronic disease later life  We found dangers quite substantial   especially women  Women working 60 hours per week  equivalent 12 hours per day  three times likely eventually suffer heart disease  cancer  arthritis diabetes  twice likely chronic lung disease asthma  women working conventional 40 hour workweek  Working bit more  average 41 50 hours per week  many years appeared substantially increase long term risk disease  These studies show hours created equal  The research suggests harm may occur past certain point   A four day week causes workers squeeze hours usual day  For workers already prone overwork  additional burden compressing five days four could literally break camel s   worker s   back  Is stress worth it  Besides health issues  employers workers also need consider effect compressing hours four day period workers  mental health  stress levels fatigue  Occupational psychologists realize people function effectively tired stressed  This may even concern older persons  Moreover  squeezing five days 10 hour a day work compressed 40 hour schedule create rigidity reduced flexibility families children  For example  two additional work hours per day added onto conventional day schedule begins morning approximately 8 9 a m  extends late afternoon hours 4 5 p m  many working parents lose ability interact children  prime time  5 7 p m  kids otherwise would likely house potentially available socialize siblings parents   bedtime arrives  There many obvious ways address concerns make life easier workers families  Don t overwork  Don t stay long work  Find job employer flexible working hours  Join conversation See

tempting glance work email   couple notes jot down  Instead  pull back certain point  Maybe it s time take Friday every often  How ending work noon Fridays  practice many Jews  bring weekend gradual way  The trade off  necessary  would involve adding small increase one hour per day normal Monday Friday schedule  That approach actually personal favorite  My friend Lonnie Golden  professor

parents support moments confusion  A lot people  instead transitioning friends community  gets transitioned onto technology  times stress   feeling  overwhelmed  challenged where go  They go Netflix social media  YouTube  whatever  says Benjamin   We tend defer pain numb rather really facing it  It seems filling gap  No one I spoke authentic relating movement sold therapy equivalent  people found game nights help improve mood alleviate anxiety  I certainly felt game night high afterward  Jonathan  partner earlier evening  told authentic relating thing helped stabilize depression  Sara Ness said authentic relating improved confidence teenage hood lonely  awkward geek  hadn t yet learned social skills   You re witnessing other s humanity  way maybe don t often get share  Grover qualms authentic relating movement  though warn trained person hand handle difficult emotions may come could potentially dangerous  He says does  however  see similarities exercises uses techniques deployed authentic relating  As is  three Austin community s five rules being present  leaning edge  respecting confidentiality Grover also uses group therapy practice  In process reporting story  psychiatrist suggested I try group therapy help recognize I m alone anxiety career uncertainty brings  When I described authentic relating  said practice sounded helpful  might comforting interact diverse set

evening Austin  Texas  calm gray room perfect size shape circle around 30 adults  It s fairly diverse group  though men women here  Most guests look 30 younger  majority seem already know other  Right now  I know nothing else people I spend next three hours with  I m expecting I soon we  authentically relate  one another  We re gathered game night  cornerstone authentic relating movement  aims give people tools connect meaningfully others  The movement  still grassroots  growing  began San Francisco late 1990s presence 50 communities 14 different countries throughout world  Some biggest outposts Austin  Boulder  Montreal  Amsterdam  authentic relating techniques taught practiced schools  software companies  start ups  Sara Ness  movement s unofficial organizer founder Authentic Revolution  Austin outfit  estimates 4 000 5 000 people go similar game nights week around world  They play games like  Handshake  game partners make nonverbal eye contact  meet   without shaking hands   The Noticing Game  also known  intersubjective meditation  pair goes back forth sharing perception other s actions answers anxious  argumentative  confident  guarded on  The movement manual  curated Ness  around 150 games created facilitators world over   Authentic relating  rather vague term  People I spoke described variously tool  technology  kind magic Jedi skill  jokingly  Like human relationships themselves  practice hard define easier experience  Authentic relating uses exercises  games  teach skills necessary quickly create deep  meaningful human connection  But plainest human language I explain it  Authentic relating uses exercises  games  teach facilitate skills  like curiosity empathy  necessary quickly create deep  meaningful human connection  In period loneliness increasing avenues connecting expand  practitioners tell drawn community makes conversing relating one another intentional activity one guidelines structure designed elicit intimacy   On basic level  gives people place excuse connect other  need wellness  says Ness  But Ness enthusiasts also believe techniques practiced authentic relating exercises help users develop agency sense self begin better relate others  The theme evening  owning experience  Victor  first time head facilitator  longtime practitioner  quiets casual chatter give speech   Three and a half years ago I came authentic relating games I played I first got here I started able realize experiences experiences  If ask past  I m going tell trauma  things nerve racking  things years ago I would shared anybody  I want

night progresses  Everyone seems open experience it is  all  self selecting group  After reconnect past selves  pair partner share selves  Most games heavily structured  length exercises shares  the

evening  With conversation structure already place normal anxieties social interaction absent  I wasn t asking questions people please polite make small talk  I wasn t worried group members would bored turned talking myself  The one directional flow attention toward one individual allowed us share uninhibited interruption pretense   Revealing something vulnerable rush   With attention purely  in hot seat  I opportunity explore deeper I would  my partner  responded things like   That reminds story sister told once  says Amy Silverman Connection Movement  authentic relating group New York   That happens typical dialogue kind ping pong   Let tell something me  oh reminds something me  At Austin game night  regroup back one big circle  share exercise made us feel  One man notes people group bear  pretty intense  anger toward moms   This first night less intimate I expected be  says another man   I realized I knew people  in group  I d met I knew best friends  someone else adds  The group laughs together Stephen  facilitator  says  It sounds like resonance room  We break gluten free chocolate chip cookies  chips  salsa  tea  Bryan Bayer  one original cofounders movement  knows resonance means  After moving 20s San Francisco  Bayer group like minded friends began challenge one another completely honest feelings anything felt like withholding due shame fear said in attempt build intimacy  The practice rewarding began think could bring world eventually developed early games programming   It created type closeness whenever went little parties types gatherings  people would like   Hey  guys on  Can I some  like   No  we re high raw honesty  says Bayer   Just revealing something vulnerable rush  thrill   The thing heals someone relationship  The thrill which described involved practice helped movement spread  usually person person  captivated joy already initiated seemed possess  The facilitators I spoke mentioned seeking deeper connections personal relationships getting involved authentic relating  One Austin attendee named David  game night second time  told finding authentic relating like  bringing fish water  At event I attended  three quarters participants repeat guests like him  Regulars really take weekly games nights become member Austin authentic relating community   Each individual game night  10 without membership  free members  There are  course  plenty ways meet people join community don t involve sitting  hot seat  people pepper personal questions  Some means  though  decline religion  even traditional office spaces  example  But initiates authentic relating paint picture meaningful  exhilarating connection that s difficult find day to day   For me  thing heals someone relationship  said Sean Grover  psychotherapist runs one largest group therapy practices country New York   Lack attunement people norm  Technologies  cellphones  people tune other  Social media obvious oft cited culprit  Peter Benjamin  life coach helped build authentic relating games community Boston  thinks many people started fill holes lives technology instead relationships   Ostensibly we re supposed go depending parents support moments confusion  A lot people  instead transitioning friends community  gets transitioned onto technology  times stress   feeling  overwhelmed  challenged where go  They go Netflix social media  YouTube  whatever  says Benjamin   We tend defer pain numb rather really facing it  It seems filling gap  No one I spoke authentic relating movement sold therapy equivalent  people found game nights help improve mood alleviate anxiety  I certainly felt game night high afterward  Jonathan  partner earlier evening  told authentic relating thing helped stabilize depression  Sara Ness said authentic relating improved confidence teenage hood lonely  awkward geek  hadn t yet learned social skills   You re witnessing other s humanity  way maybe don t often get share  Grover qualms authentic relating movement  though warn trained person hand handle difficult emotions may come could potentially dangerous  He says does  however  see similarities exercises uses techniques deployed authentic relating  As is  three Austin community s five rules being present  leaning edge  respecting confidentiality Grover also uses group therapy practice  In process reporting story  psychiatrist suggested I try group therapy help recognize I m alone anxiety career uncertainty brings  When I described authentic relating  said practice sounded helpful  might comforting interact diverse set

positions like opposition natural gas fracking to 1970s  classically green opposition nuclear power   Even though proposed carbon tax would greatest boon nuclear power industry decades  nuclear plants emit greenhouse gases  Democratic voters still don t care climate change much  And likely would little substantive policy difference either candidate s presidency  least first  Had Clinton Sanders election  EPA would dutifully defended Clean Power Plan court  And administration would benefited one liberal seat Supreme Court help enshrine aggressive climate protections law  But Trump won  And brings us present        On October 10  Scott Pruitt formally repealed Clean Power Plan  first phase planned disembowelment Obama s environmental legacy  Pruitt assured succeed effort  Many environmental lawyers argue legal arguments particularly well supported  To push repeal through  Pruitt muck EPA s internal cost benefit calculations  His EPA changed estimates social harms carbon dioxide  calculating number 50 times smaller Obama administration used  also changed values threat air pollution poses American public  It may naught  Some environmentalists argue Clean Power Plan already accomplished main goal  sending anti coal price signal utility managers  Michael Bloomberg  UN special climate envoy former New York mayor  argued falling cost renewable energy availability cheap  bountiful natural gas help United States meet carbon reduction goals even without federal policy  But Pruitt need win total victory succeed  The Clean Power Plan repeal litigated court  EPA lobbying side deregulation  The fight last years  It may even wind front Supreme Court conservative now  The new environmental antagonism seem run directly counter worker interests  No one knows future  it s hard sketch possibilities  Pruitt may well secure ruling effectively keeps Clean Air Act ever regulating greenhouse gases  Even fails  future Trump EPA may succeed permanently limiting law s regulatory power  And climate concerned Democrat next enters White House  whether 2020  2024  2028  may find Obama administration s main policy implement fighting carbon emissions dulled uselessness  Attorneys future EPA will  point  probably improvise new way address climate change regulation  They choice  But likely need  too  new legislation  What Democrats do        Democrats face least three major problems trying formulate climate policy  First  relationship environmentalists labor groups disintegrated since 2009  Once upon time  unions widely supported Waxman Markey  The bill funded assistance workers put work transition away fossil fuels launched  green job  retraining programs  It also provided tens billions funding  carbon capture sequestration  experimental technology would possibly allowed coal plants keep running  But failed  pan Democratic consensus fell apart it  Neither two climate strategies succeeded Waxman Markey offer particular appeal organized labor  The Clean Power Plan essentially made nonprofits already strapped state budgets  in GOP governed states  responsible softening economic blow carbon regulation  In large part  declined  The antagonistic approach pipelines fossil fuel projects also alienated labor  Construction union workers still spend much time building pipelines installing renewables  Divorced unified legislative campaign and promise federal funding the new environmental antagonism seem run directly counter worker interests  Many voters trust Democrats legislative plan resolve climate crisis  This isn t necessarily fault antagonists alone  Unionization renewable industry also lagging  Renewable energy companies often anti union California based tech firm  In October  instance  Tesla which swears trying hire employees fast can fired 400 700 workers many analysts understood union busting move  United Auto Workers filed complaint National Labor Relations Board  Green energy companies don t harbor anti regulatory  Silicon Valley style dislike organized labor  They also see fighting desperate battle price oil gas companies  Every cent union might add production cost  argue  cent disadvantages fossil fuels  The green labor breakdown party s biggest political obstacle  But second problem Democratic voters still don t care climate change much  Like Americans  party s electorate experience  low intensity  issue  Though majority Americans every state believe climate change  people use climate policy decide vote for  Even Democrats say candidate s proposed climate policy matters less making voting decision proposed policies jobs  health care  economy  education  income inequality  terrorism  As happens  Trump helping solve problem  Due steady siege Obama era climate policy  seems motivating rank and file Democrats address issue  His withdrawal Paris Agreement much unpopular treaty itself  But remains unclear whether passage climate policy motivates supporters aggravates alienates issue s  anti constituency   such coal oil workers  Finally  dealing climate change policy hard  Most good news climate change lately come power sector  emissions dropped 18 percent last five years  But electricity production makes 29 percent total U S  greenhouse gas emissions  For United States decarbonize which even newest optimistic projections say must proceed historically unprecedented pace it must also tackle carbon pollution sectors  If Democrats win Congress White House  history suggests get sliver time commit kind new policy statute  Those sectors tougher crack  Most emissions transportation sector  which makes quarter U S  greenhouse gas pollution  come cars trucks  In order draw emissions 2050  consumers opt electric vehicles en masse service stations erect electric chargers across country  Analysts say that s unlikely occur without large public investment  And ideas tackle 21 percent U S  emissions come industrial manufacturing sector        These questions pressing seem  Eighteen months now  Democratic policy advisers meet develop chosen candidate s primary policies  If Democrats win unified control Congress White House in  say  2020  history suggests get sliver time commit kind new policy statute public opinion turns them  During window  dozens issues compete law makers  attention  In light  consider Democrats treated health care past 10 months  While there s party wide consensus  small groups voters around country organized around issue  calling senators every day months  More third Democratic senators supported bill introduce single national health insurer  And Bernie Sanders  party s 2020 frontrunner  debated Trumpcare  in many forms  CNN several times  In sum  many Democrats coalesced around single phrase  if quite policy accompany it  promised deliver next time they re power  And even Democrats see  Medicare All  base play as slogan likely deployed Vermont Colorado it remains policy focused promise future governance  The party similar promises issues  too  On immigration  promise DREAM Act  LGBT rights  Equality Act  I suspect many voters  including rank and file Democrats  believe there s similar strategy climate change  They think there s bill waiting wings would address issue  They trust Democrats legislative plan resolve climate crisis  party needs granted control Congress pass it  The days climate only bill passed  But nothing similar scale exists  Senate s vocal Democrats issue resist formulating one  Sheldon Whitehouse  delivers weekly climate themed haranguing Senate floor  recently told Vox s Jeff Stein way politically solve global warming convert Republicans cause  There two bills come close serving flagship bill  The first 100  50 Act  released April Senators Jeff Merkley Oregon Bernie Sanders Vermont

Eugene Stoner designed AR 15 around powder known IMR 4475  improved military rifle  It produced Du Pont  sold Remington fill cartridges  It made nitrocellulose  sometimes known guncotton  IMR 4475 ammunition used early tests AR 15  ammunition proven reliable field trials acceptance Air Force  In June 1963  Army Materiel Command conducted tests Frankford Arsenal discredited original IMR powder

held authority time  The official explanations available ones  couched bureaucratese  Colonel Yount offered asked time Representative Ichord s committee justify ordnance corps done  The decision ammunition turned detailed specifications  known  technical data package  Army drew converted rifle M 16  The data package included requirements muzzle velocity rifle must average 3 250 feet per second  fps  plus minus 40  pressure within firing chamber must exceed 52 000 pounds per square inch  Where specifications come from  Not Eugene Stoner  Armalite  users testers rifle  Stoner based design off the shelf commercial cartridge packed IMR powder  never attained muzzle velocity Army specified  Some Army officials claimed manufacturer advertised bullet 3 250 fps velocity  so  chose believe commercials rather way bullet actually performed  In previous tests  field trails made Air Force Marines enthusiastic it  successful performance combat Vietnam  AR 15 original ammunition produced muzzle velocity 100 fps newly specified level  What  then  basis Army s decision  The congressional committee tried dozen different ways get Colonel Yount answer question  The closest thing response hearing records contain following paragraph   Statement Propellants 5 56mm Ammunition  Army submitted Yount s testimony  In course 5 56mm ammunition program  Army could elected reduce specified velocity  thus avoiding necessity developing new propellants   This would reduced somewhat range effectiveness M 16 rifle  Instead  Army chose maintain original  sic  ballistic performance  utilize propellants could meet requirements consistently mass production  Once Army set specifications  result tests Frankford Arsenal predetermined  original IMR powder would do  To get velocity 3 250 fps  bring chamber pressure close limit  In February 1964  Army sent request manufacturers come substitute powders  A months later  Du Pont said would stop producing IMR  Remington switched Army s supplier  ball powder  Olin Mathieson  By end 1964  Remington loading ball powder cartridges rifle  renamed M 16   Another kind IMR powder  explosive characteristics different original s  eventually produced alternate ammunition M 16  Ball powder first adopted army early World War II  use certain artillery rounds  It differs IMR  double based   made nitrocellulose nitroglycerine  several ways  Its important difference explosive characteristics  burns longer slowly IMR  Only one company United States produces ball powder sells Army  That Olin Mathieson  received contracts 89 million cartridges 1964 alone  far war went on  More 90 percent cartridges used Vietnam loaded ball powder  After Army made decision switch ball powder  sent representative  Frank Vee  comptroller s office  try get Eugene Stoner endorse change  Stoner consulted modifications rifle  bolt closure barrel twist ball powder  thought bad ideas  He recalled congressional committee meeting Vee  He asked opinion  about specs requiring ball powder  fact  In words  rather odd meeting    I looked technical data package said   What opinion  I said   I would advise it    I asked   So going happen  And said   Well  already decided way going go  meaning committee  I said   So asking now  said   I would felt better approved package  And I said   Well  don t feel good  The reason Stoner s concern change powders destroyed qualities built rifle  With ball powder  M 16 looked better Army s new specifications sheets worse operation  There two problems  One  fouling a powder residue inside gas tube chamber eventually made rifle jam  The AR 15 designed gas port stayed close combustion powder  different powder  The new ball powder inherently dirtier  burned longer  still burned gas port opened  burned gas tube  The effect ball powder increase rifle s  cyclic rate  The AR 15  interlocking mechanical cycles  designed fire 750 800 rounds per minute  When cartridges loaded ball powder used  rate went 1 000 more   When Army said   No  going use ammunition  cyclic rate weapons went least 200 rounds per minute  Stoner told congressional committee   That gun would jump 750 1 000 rounds minute  change changing ammunition  The consequences higher cyclic rate grave  What supremely reliable rifle given chronic jams breakdowns  In November 1965  engineers Colt fired number rifles  original IMR powder ball  They reported   For weapons used experiment  none likely fail ammunition  IMR  whereas half likely fail ammunition  ball powder  In December  Frankford Arsenal conducted another test malfunctions  When M 16s loaded IMR cartridges  3 2 malfunctions per 1 000 rounds   75 stoppages  When rifles fired ball propellant  failure rates six times higher  18 5 5 2  respectively  Under

dispossessed two decades independence  politics land became inseparable  A days visit Smith reading morning newspaper came across government notice listing latest batch farms designated seizure state  His farm among them  For man learned would lose livelihood  passion  family home  Smith strangely unflustered  Largely ignored since independence  seems found blind bungling Robert Mugabe s regime

Change,There s wrinkle United States talks climate change 2017  tension fundamental issue s politics widely ignored  On one hand  Democrats party climate change  Since 1990s  public belief global warming become strongly polarized  Democratic Party emerged advocate aggressive climate action  The recent Democratic president made climate policy centerpiece second term  party s national politicians lament oppose undoing work  Concern climate isn t elite issue  either  Rank and file Democrats likely worry global warming median voter  On hand  Democratic Party plan address climate change  This true almost every level policy making process  It consensus bill issue waiting wings  shared vision bill could look like  guiding slogan like  Medicare all to express wants stop global warming  Many people party know want something climate change  there s agreement something may be  This lack trying  Democrats struggled formulate post Obama climate policy substantive political obstacles stand way  They yet identified mechanism make dent Earth s costly  irreversible warming uniting many factions coalition  These problems could keep party scrambling face climate crisis years come        The roots crisis go back 2009  Democrats held unified control White House Congress  The end last decade unique moment climate politics  Thanks string intense hurricane years  unexpected success Al Gore s documentary An Inconvenient Truth  public support addressing climate change legislation higher ever been  Democrats responded American Clean Energy Security Act  widely known  Waxman Markey  two sponsors  Congressmen Henry Waxman California Edward Markey Massachusetts  The bill proposed creating carbon emissions trading market across United States  Under terms  government would distributed number  right emit carbon  credits companies  could bought sold other  As years passed  government would allot fewer credits  forcing price emitting carbon increase  would in theory ultimately decrease amount carbon dioxide released atmosphere  When Waxman Markey failed  pan Democratic consensus fell apart it  Though little technical  pollution market proven idea U S  environmental law  George H W  Bush established similar  cap and trade  system presidency reduce pollutants create acid rain  In June 2009  Waxman Markey passed House  But summer wore on  bill s prospects floundered  By August  Tea Party rose command media attention  public opinion turned Democrats  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid focused passing would become Affordable Care Act declined take climate bill Senate floor  By middle next summer  Waxman Markey effectively dead  Only years opened  window pass climate legislation already shut  Even defeat  Waxman Markey cost party dearly  More two dozen congressional Democrats supported cap and trade bill lost 2010 midterm election  The casualties included Rick Boucher  14 term veteran Congress whose district included much southwest Virginia s coal country  Boucher negotiated concessions local coal companies Waxman Markey  could save seat  Ten House Democrats  including Boucher  voted Waxman Markey Affordable Care Act  Six lost

I ll take dead aim cap and trade bill  said commercial  received wide media coverage  So Waxman Markey failed  And then  freed unified campaign  American progressives took climate policy two different directions  Many activists came see climate change one symptom dehumanized capitalism  First  Obama administration pressed ahead plans use Clean Air Act limit carbon dioxide   This power predated presidency  In 2007  Supreme Court told EPA must consider regulating greenhouse gases law  This push eventually produced Clean Power Plan 2015  set rules meant reduce greenhouse gas emissions power sector 30 percent historic peak  Though dominated press coverage Obama s climate policy  Clean Power Plan never actually took effect  In February 2016  Supreme Court blocked gaining force law  But administration got many rules aimed drawing carbon pollution books end Obama s term  Second  swath environmentalists abandoned hope passing climate legislation returned grassroots  project by project approach  Instead reducing greenhouse gas emissions law  activists hoped deprive oil companies social license operate altogether  Chief among new groups 350 org  led author Bill McKibben  350 opposed Keystone XL pipeline  mega infrastructure project linked Canadian tar sands U S  export terminals  warning completion would spell  game climate  In 2010  Sierra Club also began use environmental litigation public pressure shut hundreds coal burning power plants part Beyond Coal campaign  This climate antagonism one aspect left s general resurgence period  Inspired part Naomi Klein s 2014 book This Changes Everything  many activists came see climate change one symptom dehumanized extractive capitalism  These two sides even something proxy battle 2016 Democratic primary  During race  Hillary Clinton opposed carbon tax endorsed Obama administration s ongoing regulatory efforts  Sanders endorsed carbon tax called aggressive investment climate mitigation  Unlike Clinton s policies  Sanders would surely required Democratic Congress enshrine policies  In ways  though  2016 primary imperfect battleground climate policy  Sanders seek energy economist s ideal climate policy  He wedded climate hawk positions like opposition natural gas fracking to 1970s  classically green opposition nuclear power   Even though proposed carbon tax would greatest boon nuclear power industry decades  nuclear plants emit greenhouse gases  Democratic voters still don t care climate change much  And likely would little substantive policy difference either candidate s presidency  least first  Had Clinton Sanders election  EPA would dutifully defended Clean Power Plan court  And administration would benefited one liberal seat Supreme Court help enshrine aggressive climate protections law  But Trump won  And brings us present        On October 10  Scott Pruitt formally repealed Clean Power Plan  first phase planned disembowelment Obama s environmental legacy  Pruitt assured succeed effort  Many environmental lawyers argue legal arguments particularly well supported  To push repeal through  Pruitt muck EPA s internal cost benefit calculations  His EPA changed estimates social harms

Plan already accomplished main goal  sending anti coal price signal utility managers  Michael Bloomberg  UN special climate envoy former New York mayor  argued falling cost renewable energy availability cheap  bountiful natural gas help United States meet carbon reduction goals even without federal policy  But Pruitt need win total victory succeed  The Clean Power Plan repeal litigated court  EPA lobbying side deregulation  The fight last years  It may even wind front Supreme Court conservative now  The new environmental antagonism seem run directly counter worker interests  No one knows future  it s hard sketch possibilities  Pruitt may well secure ruling effectively keeps Clean Air Act ever regulating greenhouse gases  Even fails  future Trump EPA may succeed permanently limiting law s regulatory power  And climate concerned Democrat next enters White House  whether 2020  2024  2028  may find Obama administration s main policy implement fighting carbon emissions dulled uselessness  Attorneys future EPA will  point  probably improvise new way address climate change regulation  They choice  But likely need  too  new legislation  What Democrats do        Democrats face least three major problems trying formulate climate policy  First  relationship environmentalists labor groups disintegrated since 2009  Once upon time  unions widely supported Waxman Markey  The bill funded assistance workers put work transition away fossil fuels launched  green job  retraining programs  It also provided tens billions funding  carbon capture sequestration  experimental technology would possibly allowed coal plants keep running  But failed  pan Democratic consensus fell apart it  Neither two climate strategies succeeded Waxman Markey offer particular appeal organized labor  The Clean Power Plan essentially made nonprofits already strapped state budgets  in GOP governed states  responsible softening economic blow carbon regulation  In large part  declined  The antagonistic approach pipelines fossil fuel projects also alienated labor  Construction union workers still spend much time building pipelines installing renewables  Divorced unified legislative campaign and promise federal funding the new environmental antagonism seem run directly counter worker interests  Many voters trust Democrats legislative plan resolve climate crisis  This isn t necessarily fault antagonists alone  Unionization renewable industry also lagging  Renewable energy companies often anti union California based tech firm  In October  instance  Tesla which swears trying hire employees fast can fired 400 700 workers many analysts understood union busting move  United Auto Workers filed complaint National Labor Relations Board  Green energy companies don t harbor anti regulatory  Silicon Valley style dislike organized labor  They also see fighting desperate battle price oil gas companies  Every cent union might add production cost  argue  cent disadvantages fossil fuels  The green labor breakdown party s biggest political obstacle  But second problem Democratic voters still don t care climate change much  Like Americans  party s electorate experience  low intensity  issue  Though majority Americans every state believe climate change  people use climate policy decide vote for  Even Democrats say candidate s proposed climate policy matters less making voting decision proposed policies jobs  health care  economy  education  income inequality  terrorism  As happens  Trump helping solve problem  Due steady siege Obama era climate policy  seems motivating rank and file Democrats address issue  His withdrawal Paris Agreement much unpopular treaty itself  But remains unclear whether passage climate policy motivates supporters aggravates alienates issue s  anti constituency   such coal oil workers  Finally  dealing climate change policy hard  Most good news climate change lately come power sector  emissions dropped 18 percent last five years  But electricity production makes 29 percent total U S  greenhouse gas emissions  For United States decarbonize which even newest optimistic projections say must proceed historically unprecedented pace it must also tackle carbon pollution sectors  If Democrats win Congress White House  history suggests get sliver time commit kind new policy statute  Those sectors tougher crack  Most emissions transportation sector  which makes quarter U S  greenhouse gas pollution  come cars trucks  In order draw emissions 2050  consumers opt electric vehicles en masse service stations erect electric chargers across country  Analysts say that s unlikely occur without large public investment  And ideas tackle 21 percent U S  emissions come industrial manufacturing sector        These questions pressing seem  Eighteen months now  Democratic policy advisers meet develop chosen candidate s primary policies  If Democrats win unified control Congress White House in  say  2020  history suggests get sliver time commit kind new policy statute public opinion turns them  During window  dozens issues compete law makers  attention  In light  consider Democrats treated health care past 10 months  While there s party wide consensus  small groups voters around country organized around issue  calling senators every day months  More third Democratic senators supported bill introduce single national health insurer  And Bernie Sanders  party s 2020 frontrunner  debated Trumpcare  in many forms  CNN several times  In sum  many Democrats coalesced around single phrase  if quite policy accompany it  promised deliver next time they re power  And even Democrats see  Medicare All  base play as slogan likely deployed Vermont Colorado it remains policy focused promise future governance  The party similar promises issues  too  On immigration  promise DREAM Act  LGBT rights  Equality Act  I suspect many voters  including rank and file Democrats  believe there s similar strategy climate change  They think there s bill waiting wings would address issue  They trust Democrats legislative plan resolve climate crisis  party needs granted control Congress pass it  The days climate only bill passed  But nothing similar scale exists  Senate s vocal Democrats issue resist formulating one  Sheldon Whitehouse  delivers weekly climate themed haranguing Senate floor  recently told Vox s Jeff Stein way politically solve global warming convert Republicans cause  There two bills come close serving flagship bill  The first 100  50 Act  released April Senators Jeff Merkley
